&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the Wikimedia Foundation Android team has focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/Android/Communication&quot;&gt;improving the communications experience&lt;/a&gt; in the Wikipedia Android app. Asynchronous collaboration is a core component of the Wikipedia editing experience, and the lower the entry barrier to editing, the more diverse the content will be for our 14 projects across 300 languages. This diversity of content and collaborators is core to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Movement_Strategy&quot;&gt;movement strategy&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on knowledge equity and knowledge as a service. The movement strategy brings us closer to ensuring our projects represent the sum of all knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the organization focuses on knowledge equity, the Product and Technology departments have worked on a&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/the-journey-to-make-wikipedias-technology-more-equitable-152321df1366&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;framework for inclusive product development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To ensure the framework was reflective of the varying scope and team composition of our development teams, seven Wikimedia Foundation teams signed up to test the playbook and provide feedback. The feedback would serve as an input for V2 of the playbook in our framework. With our team’s goal of reducing the barrier to communication and collaboration in the Wikipedia Android app and being very &lt;a href=&quot;https://diff.wikimedia.org/2022/01/21/accessibility-support-in-the-wikipedia-android-app/&quot;&gt;intentional about accessibility&lt;/a&gt;, we were a logical test team for the playbook. We also recognized there would be a lot to balance as we worked towards this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the original request to improve communications in the apps came from experienced members of our community that largely wrote in English, we wanted to be very intentional about partnering with members of the community who haven’t been historically centered in our projects. Depending on the development team and platform the partner communities could look different. In our context, the identified partner community members consisted of women and non-binary editors on Japanese Wikipedia, French and Arabic editors in Mali, Egypt, Morocco, and DR Congo, Hindi and Indonesian Wikipedia editors, English Wikipedia editors in Nigeria and visually impaired English Wikipedia editors in India. You can read more about our process in selecting these partner communities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/Android/2021Roadmap?tableofcontents=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/audio&gt;

	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Listen the pronunciation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In German, there’s a popular idiom of the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eierlegende_Wollmilchsau&quot;&gt;Eierlegende Wollmilchsau&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/strong&gt; It roughly translates to an egg-laying wool-milk-pig. The phrase describes an imaginary animal that combines unique characteristics of some of the most renowned animal species: chicken (lay eggs), sheep (provide wool), cow (give milk), and pig (meat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idiom encapsulates what we are trying to achieve; a seemingly unachievable and perfect outcome of a product for diverse user needs: all the benefits, no drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article shares the steps we took to develop a design approach that reflects the ideal the egg-laying wool-milk-pig represents. When you finish reading, we hope you come away with the following lessons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The importance of &lt;strong&gt;designing with people&lt;/strong&gt; instead of for them&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding when to focus and when to see the big picture&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;User Segmentation: Meeting audiences where they are&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leveraging Data: Data doesn’t show where to go; it shows where you are&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Focus Mode: Adding capabilities without distraction&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customization as a means to include:&lt;/strong&gt; Optimizing the article experience based on different user goals&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-shape-our-tools-thereafter-our-tools-shape-us&quot;&gt;“We shape our tools, thereafter our tools shape us”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan&quot;&gt;Marshall McLuhan&lt;/a&gt; feels very true for Wikipedia. Here’s why: When we &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxdesign.cc/in-search-of-the-perfect-search-for-wikipedia-136f86ac6168&quot;&gt;improved searching for articles&lt;/a&gt;, we realized that people use Wikipedia in unique ways. Use cases and opinions for those who regularly use the Wikipedia app vary substantially. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/Android/Communication/UsertestingJuly2021?tableofcontents=0#Results&quot;&gt;difference of perspectives&lt;/a&gt; even rang true when learning from our target audiences what their communication preferences were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editors&lt;/strong&gt; see a need for more editing capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The only missing feature is providing notifications like on the website”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readers&lt;/strong&gt; love to read articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Why would I need Wikipedia notifications? I don’t even have a login!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wikipedians&lt;/strong&gt; long for missing key features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Please make it possible to access talk pages and edit histories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And others&lt;/strong&gt; simply prefer the Wikipedia web experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Functionally very similar to the web browser experience, if not less intuitive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a tiny sample of the sometimes contradictory feedback we receive from people using our app primarily or in conjunction with other platforms. However, these examples exemplify that qualitative feedback points us in multiple directions, especially when we weigh the maturity of a wiki. So, when user feedback pulls us in multiple directions, how do we decide where to go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be easy to rely on the intuition of the team. However, as we learned from the Inclusive Product Development framework, even with a globally dispersed, fully remote team that aims to live up to the organizational &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2022/01/10/surfacing-and-embracing-diversity-within-your-team.html&quot;&gt;goal of embracing diversity&lt;/a&gt;, we must be wary of introducing our biases into the product and strive to be inclusive of these different audience goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-doesnt-show-where-to-go-it-shows-where-you-are&quot;&gt;Data doesn’t show where to go, it shows where you are&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we delve deeper into our quantitative data, there’s evidence of commonalities amongst different cultures, use cases, and needs. Our data scientist, Shay Nowick, was able to provide the insight that &lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.wikimedia.org/published/reports/wikipedia-android-app/metrics/2021-03.html&quot;&gt;62%&lt;/a&gt; of those that opt-in to share anonymized data visit the article view most frequently in the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure--image&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/egg-laying-wool-milk-pig/2-article-view.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Article View&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
The article view is the most visited screen in the app.


&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This insight seemed logical considering the Wikipedia Android app was initially created as a “readers-first” tool. It always had editing capabilities, but the editing experience was historically limited, had a high participation barrier and resulted in a low edit count compared to other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-areas-to-create-the-egg-laying-wool-milk-pig&quot;&gt;Focus areas to create the egg-laying wool-milk-pig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;balancing-reading-and-editing&quot;&gt;Balancing reading and editing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://diff.wikimedia.org/2021/11/30/wikipedia-and-apps-a-love-story/&quot;&gt;“readers first” strategy&lt;/a&gt; shifted from full-article editing to explore the concept of micro contributions with the introduction of a feature called suggested edits. Micro contributions aim to lower the barrier to contributing by introducing an alternative to longform writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure--image&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/egg-laying-wool-milk-pig/3-suggested-edits.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Suggested Edits&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
Suggested edits present opportunities for small but vital contributions to Wikipedia. We are aiming to raise edit awareness and make contributing more accessible.


&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we identified it as gentle onboarding for new editors, and creating new forms of content. As this capability was rolled out, the visibility and editing calls to action (CTA) were intentionally made prominent on the home page toolbar and in the frequently visited article view, shifting the UI away from the “readers first” experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this change could ultimately distract someone who just had the goal of reading as you can see in the example below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure--image&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/egg-laying-wool-milk-pig/4-edit-calls.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Edit calls&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
Multiple edit calls to action distract from reading the article.


&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data shows that the edit asks were somewhat effective in encouraging readers to add missing article information. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+ ADD ARTICLE DESCRIPTION&lt;/code&gt; button alone is the source of almost a fourth of all edits (~23%) made in the Wikipedia Android app. Adding the CTAs was a deliberate strategic move to encourage editing, and it seemed to be effective. Despite the distracting nature, hiding them for all people at all times was not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to the point someone raised about not always wanting to see editing features when they’re in the mood to read, how could we accommodate them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to not wanting to distract with too many editing call to actions, a community member left the following feedback on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; store which made us question the article’s bottom toolbar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Why have you taken away the ability to go full screen? Why do we have to see the bottom toolbar all the time?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I want the option to hide the bottom bar as I scroll down. Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure--image&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/egg-laying-wool-milk-pig/5-toolbar.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Toolbar&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
The article’s bottom toolbar stays visible when reading and scrolling.


&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usability tests from three years ago gave us the insight that some users preferred seeing the bottom toolbar at all times or struggled to find features when the toolbar disappeared.. For example one user shared:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’m deleting the app because it doesn’t support find in page”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article most certainly did support Find in page, we call it “Find in article” and it was located in the bottom toolbar that formerly disappeared on scroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reading-distraction-free&quot;&gt;Reading distraction-free&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insights mentioned above, paired with our desire to introduce more prominent editing features, like a prominent icon for talk pages to make it more discoverable, made our interest in honoring some explicit requests from the community to add a reading focus mode that much more urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose to put the reading focus mode toggle into “Theme” because it’s related to existing preferences like font size or family. When reading focus mode is enabled, CTAs disappear, and the article becomes full screen on scroll, meaning the top and bottom toolbars disappear; limiting distractions while reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a concern within the team that users would have trouble remembering how to access editing features again once reading focus mode was enabled. To ensure we could overcome this obstacle we conducted usability testing with our partner communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using a clickable design prototype, our developers created a working prototype that our participants could download:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure--video&quot;&gt;
	&lt;video src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/egg-laying-wool-milk-pig/6-prototype.webm&quot; alt=&quot;Prototype&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/video&gt;

	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Not only were people able to successfully disable the feature if they wanted to edit, they provided other positive insights as well.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s better, the full-screen mode makes it easier to read, there’s nothing that bothers me!” &lt;em&gt;– Usability test participant, Arabic Wikipedia reader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This reading focus mode is really helpful, excludes all unwanted options, it makes the page more comfortable to read” &lt;em&gt;– Usability test participant, Hindi Wikipedia reader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a good feature as the majority of us are here to read articles. It’s a good function to have to limit distractions.” &lt;em&gt;– Usability test participant, Japanese Wikipedia reader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These insights gave us the confidence to release the feature to production and enhance discoverability. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/Usability-testing-Android-Feb-2022-Analysis-c1b536068b78486e80da99c4e0461829&quot;&gt;detailed analysis&lt;/a&gt; to dig deeper into our findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading focus mode was also a success from a quantitative perspective.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;After its release, 80% of all people discovering and interacting with the feature kept it as their default preference.&lt;/strong&gt; We did consider making this feature a default experience, but wanted to ensure users knew they could edit, and for that reason we will continue to have reading focus mode disabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customizing-the-experience&quot;&gt;Customizing the experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading focus mode was not the only feature where we aimed to strike the right balance between the needs of readers and editors.&lt;/strong&gt; As we added more features to the app, our overflow menu grew, and we noticed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/Analysis-experienced-users-c78408250c5241da9cf1df9efb036cc6&quot;&gt;users asking for features&lt;/a&gt; that existed but were hidden in the overflow menu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Doesn’t allow you to read the page’s Edit history or Talk page. So practically only useful for reading, not editing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It has good features like a menu option to switch between languages”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No option to add to Watchlist, I don’t like the interface or look.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s missing categories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Please add the capability to share an article’s URL.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the maturity of the wiki, the audience, and user goals, the preferences for what links were available varied, which made it apparent that the next phase of our work before releasing new communication features needed to take a closer look at shortcut usage in the bottom toolbar and the top menu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure--image&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/egg-laying-wool-milk-pig/7-research-data.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Research Data&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
Our data informed us that the bottom toolbar and top menu usage ranking were as follows: 1. Contents (61.22%) 2. Language (17.57%) 3. Save (8.95%) 4. Find in article (5.76%) 5. Theme (3.03%) 6. Share (2.19%) 7. Explore (0.47%) 8. New tab (0.33%) 9. Categories (0.16%) 10. Edit history (0.16%) 11. Talk page (0.12%) 12. Watch (0.04%). Note that newer features, and features hidden in the overflow menu were clicked less often.


&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing for people’s preferences while keeping the experience focused challenged us, but is becoming more of an industry standard with the launch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you&quot;&gt;Material You&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Relatedly, one of our approaches to toolbar customization was inspired by Google Chrome. We explored the idea of adding all items to the top menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure--image&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/egg-laying-wool-milk-pig/8-actions-destinations.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Actions and Destinations&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
Access to the actions and destinations in Chrome on Android.


&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked ourselves if putting all options into one place is considered good or bad information architecture and found the answer in existing research. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/&quot;&gt;Hiding interface elements reduces their usage&lt;/a&gt; as they are less discoverable.&lt;/strong&gt; We did not want actions related to the article to be less used, as our audience finds them helpful, so we continued with having shortcuts in the bottom toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-the-egg-laying-wool-milk-pig-came-to-life&quot;&gt;How the-egg-laying wool-milk-pig came to life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototyping-the-first-version&quot;&gt;Prototyping the first version&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We landed on letting people customize their shortcuts in the bottom toolbar, and developed several prototypes to test which approach best achieved our goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned that people had difficulties discovering the “Customize toolbar” feature within the “Theme” shortcut, trouble discovering where items that were moved out of the toolbar and into the overflow menu were placed and issues dragging and dropping items, a gesture we incorrectly assumed would be intuitive. This implored us to have a closer look and ensure our drag and drop movements met Web Accessibility Guidelines(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boia.org/blog/how-drag-and-drop-movements-affect-web-accessibility&quot;&gt;WCAG&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure--video&quot;&gt;
	&lt;video src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/egg-laying-wool-milk-pig/10-customizable-toolbar.webm&quot; alt=&quot;Customizable Toolbar&quot; controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;/video&gt;

	
	&lt;figcaption&gt;The original design for the customizable toolbar had usability shortcomings. Participants ignored the blue tooltip for discovery and couldn&apos;t drag and drop.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the discoverability issues we added onboarding tooltips, even with this addition, users were struggling to find the feature and effectively scrolled past it making it disappear. You can read our &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T298978&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; for full details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-discarding-and-iterating&quot;&gt;Testing, discarding, and iterating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We now faced a real example from the inclusive product development playbook of having to choose equity over speed.&lt;/strong&gt; After sharing the results with our communities and collaborating with other Wikimedia Foundation teams like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Design&quot;&gt;design team&lt;/a&gt;, we created two iterations of the original design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure--image&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/egg-laying-wool-milk-pig/11-variants.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Variants&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;
Variant A featured a ‘More’ menu item in the bottom toolbar alongside four shortcuts that could be customized. Variant B used the top menu as the entry point to customization, leaving the bottom toolbar largely unchanged.


&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal was to determine which of the two versions participants preferred, why they preferred it, if there were differences amongst language preferences and if the participant would use the feature. Both variants featured:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A persistent tooltip that only disappears when pressing the newly added ‘GOT IT’ button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In partnership with UX copywriter Jacqui Clydesdale, we created default helper tooltips to explain the drag and drop function.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simplified language (e.g., ‘shortcuts’ instead of ‘links’), to ensure terminology was accessible .&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing one more round of usability tests, we gathered feedback on the two variants from ten Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, Indonesian, and French-speaking participants. The results were almost evenly split, so we could not take a majority wins approach. It was evident that both variants were drastic improvements when it came to discoverability and usability. With no clear winner between the two variants we took into consideration Google material design guidance, and considered which change would be less jarring for our existing audiences. This led us to move forward with variant B. The reactions to the updates in &lt;strong&gt;variant B were&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s awesome, it was easy to understand and find.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The design is very good, I haven’t seen this anywhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’d use the feature 2-3 times and think it’d improve the experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a very good feature for people who use Wikipedia daily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There’s one more shortcut in the bottom toolbar, a lot of people have a habit of clicking the top menu to look for things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we chose our path forward between the two variants, there were still issues that were exposed in usability testing that we found important to address before a full roll out could occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;designing-cross-cultural&quot;&gt;Designing cross-cultural&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we mentioned above, we aimed to partner with very specific audiences. When conducting usability testing it was important to test with our partner community in their native languages.&lt;/strong&gt; Building real installable app versions in Android’s file format &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apk_(file_format)&quot;&gt;apk&lt;/a&gt; made the difference. &lt;strong&gt;Due to testing working app versions, we identified various localization issues, and prioritized solving them before release&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the Wikimedia Foundation it is customary to use an open-source translation service in partnership with our community called &lt;a href=&quot;https://translatewiki.net/&quot;&gt;translatewiki.net&lt;/a&gt;. The project, made available by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translatewiki.net&quot;&gt;Niklas Laxström&lt;/a&gt;, is sensitive to the unique vocabulary used on Wikipedia and is able to consider nuances that machine translation doesn’t always capture. However, because it is community sourced, we do have to take our time in waiting for the translations to come through, or even reaching out for support before launching usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, a third of our readers access Wikipedia in multiple languages. As usability test participants were bilingual too, we noticed that people’s device and app language differed. This is not necessarily bad, as it leads to observing even more diverse forms of use. However, for our purposes we deliberately wanted to test in Arabic, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, and French, so we asked people to set their device language at the beginning of the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step was very important because it exposed bugs and unexpected behaviors for right-to-left (RTL) environments earlier than waiting for users to alert us via the app store. Namely, when conducting usability testing, we observed glaring bugs with the direction of typography, icons, and images in RTL that needed to be corrected prior to release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the support of our Product and Technology leadership to build for equity over speed, conducting design research in regions and languages beyond the English-speaking community will continue to be our team’s default. As will it continue to be our team’s default to prioritize fixing potential localization challenges and improving accessibility across cultures, languages, abilities, interests and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an egg-laying wool-milk pig does not exist in nature, we have the unique opportunity to design the closest ideal in a digital product. And, by fulfilling one user group’s needs, tremendous advantages will inevitably present itself in serving the needs of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are committed to equitably&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2020/05/21/improve-ux-for-everyone.html&quot;&gt;design with everyone&lt;/a&gt; and modify the proverbial table to include as many as possible — and we think you should too&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As hinted at in the name, the purpose of the Wikimedia Foundation’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Growth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Growth team&lt;/a&gt; is to grow the number of new people who come and make a first edit on Wikipedia, and to keep more of them around (a.k.a. “editor retention”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an element of teaching and persuasion involved, since we need to convey to the majority of people extremely familiar with using Wikipedia one way (reading and consuming information) that in fact they should consider using it quite differently (participating in writing and changing the information), and then guiding them how to use it in this brand new way. It’s like telling someone who has eaten eggs their whole life that actually, the egg shells can be eaten as a calcium supplement too, if properly prepared (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food#cite_note-31&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it’s true&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach to this mission has been to work briskly, and try out our ideas of how to provide opportunities to edit as a series of experiments. Instead of releasing a new feature or tool for everyone and iterating on the results, we test them out on smaller groups (typically limited to people on a few smaller Wikipedia languages and rarely on the bigger languages like English), then compare how the experimental feature performs against the control (the existing experience). We then iterate on the designs based on a mixture of usability feedback, community feedback, and finally from interpreting the resulting data from people using the feature (or in some cases not using it!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one of the key features on which our team has worked, we decided to run an A/B test. Whilst it is relatively common for the Fundraising department to multivariate test small UI variations (e.g., different button placement, copy differences) on donation banners, it has been less commonly used by the Product Design team to experiment with different user experiences in reading and editing on Wikipedia itself. A major reason we don’t typically run such A/B tests is that there is a high bar for respecting the privacy of people who use Wikipedia, especially those who are anonymous&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-1&quot; id=&quot;ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, since the Growth features are offered to those who have already created an account, this was a case where A/B testing was a good fit for our purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ab-testing&quot;&gt;A/B testing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-inciting-incident-a-new-experiment&quot;&gt;The inciting incident: A new experiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew from past research that many people who create a Wikipedia account often do so with the intention of editing, but then aren’t able to easily find articles to which they can contribute. This led us to design a feature that appears for newcomers after they join Wikipedia, which encourages them to do some small “suggested edits” (like copyediting or adding links) on articles across a variety of topics they might be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/designing-experiments/suggested-edits.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a page of the new editors experiences research.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Suggested_edits_-_sample_mobile_screens.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Suggested edits - sample mobile screens&lt;/a&gt; | By RHo (WMF) | &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CC BY 4.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hypothesis underpinning this feature was that if we give people specific, and achievable small editing tasks to do, they will be more likely to try a first edit, and more of these people will do enough to build their expertise and interest to become long term contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagram below illustrates the user flow initially designed for the feature. Newcomers would first be provided with a prompt to “opt-in” to seeing these suggestions, and if they choose to proceed, they are then provided with some short onboarding screens to learn what it’s about and how to customise suggestions to their interests before seeing the actual suggested articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/designing-experiments/user-flow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Var A - Suggested edits v1.1 variant A flow diagram&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;experimenting-within-the-controlled-experiment-enter-variant-b&quot;&gt;Experimenting within the controlled experiment: Enter Variant B&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started developing the design for this feature, with the design described above as the new feature that would be implemented in a controlled experiment – comparing editing retention with a control group of new accounts which would not receive these suggested edits at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the course of development, Marshall, our Product Manager had a hypothesis that if we showed people the suggestions sooner (without onboarding), that they would do more edits. I agreed this was a valid point, and wondered how we could balance this consideration with my reasons for the importance of user education in letting people understand why doing one was valuable and relevant to them (going back to my earlier analogy of explaining how one can eat egg shells).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is how we decided to run our first simple variant test - a nested test within the controlled experiment. We would split the experiment group so that half the participants received variant A which had the “full” designed flow with opt-in and user education; whilst the other half received variant B where they would see the suggestions immediately in their newcomer homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-results-are-in-and-the-winner-is&quot;&gt;The results are in and the winner is…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with the data analyst and PM, the key metrics were examined and interpreted to figure out what was significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
	&lt;figure class=&quot;half-width&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/designing-experiments/success.png&quot; alt=&quot;Variant A vs. B for edit success 2020-06-08&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the results vindicated the user-education hypothesis! The results varied depending on the wiki and platform, but generally showed that whilst more people did indeed interact with the suggested edits module when it was shown to them immediately in variant B on desktop; in the end, more of those in variant A who had to opt-in to the feature and saw the onboarding made successful edits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-informed-iteration&quot;&gt;Data-informed iteration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did this mean for design improvements moving forward?
As we saw it, the three key takeaways from the test were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featuring suggested edits prominently&lt;/strong&gt; was key to getting people to try the tool; but at the same time…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onboarding is crucial&lt;/strong&gt; to driving more people to successfully completing an edit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile and Desktop&lt;/strong&gt; performed differently so as not to be strictly comparable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was based on these findings that the next two new variants C/D were created&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-2&quot; id=&quot;ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which applied the best aspects we interpreted from the results of the first test, roughly translated into the designs in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variants C and D centred much more on the suggested edits feature in the homepage, removing a smaller ‘start’ module and making it more prominent in size and the focus of onboarding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Onboarding is available in both variants C &amp;amp; D, though it is optional (and more easily dismissable) in variant C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On mobile, variants C and D explore different ways to give more direct access to the suggested edits feature immediately from the homepage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-decisions-affirmed-by-data&quot;&gt;Design decisions affirmed by data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was great to see our interpretation of data and design decisions payoff! In the form of both C &amp;amp; D variants in the next iteration leading to both more usage and successful edits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Chart showing the interaction, task clicks, and saved edits from the suggested edits feature on the homepage, with increases highlighted when the design was changed from to variants C and D.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;learnings-and-tips&quot;&gt;Learnings and tips&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the gratification of seeing variant tests make a difference in people’s experience of a design, it’s been a great learning experience to apply this method of design optimisation often seen as hard to utilise effectively with other more qualitative approaches.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-3&quot; id=&quot;ref-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, these are the key aspects of running A/B tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a clear, testable hypothesis.&lt;/strong&gt; Formulating the rationale for why different designs bring about better outcomes will help in devising an experiment that accurately measures the impact of those design changes. Besides that, it’s also good practice for critical thinking that is helpful for design decision making when there is no time/need to run experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine if the effort is worth the investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Once the hypothesis is set, ask whether it is worth the considerable time and investment request to run an experiment to get the answer, or whether other tactics (such as user testing) can be used instead to help move the design forward.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be bold with the variant differences.&lt;/strong&gt; If the test ends up being about different button colours, it’s probably a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/multivariate-testing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;multivariate test&lt;/a&gt; that is needed. On the other hand, it’s also not advisable to have too many variables (such as testing complete redesigns) since this would make it hard to pinpoint what changes made the difference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask the right questions of the data:&lt;/strong&gt; For our team, we care about how many people finish an edit (saving it), not if they started it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate closely with data-savvy colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt; It was vital to work closely with the data analyst and product manager to check the hypothesis and test was sound, to ensure the correct (and sufficient) data was being measured, and then properly analysed. Having an data analyst expert is also very important in removing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;, akin to having a design researcher conduct usability testing. They are the key person in determining the experiment feasibility and timeframe from an audience size perspective to get statistically significant results. For folks without an awesome analyst at hand, there are free tools available (like this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.experimentcalculator.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;) that provide sample sizes and time needed to run robust experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involve your engineering team early too.&lt;/strong&gt; Another important partnership is obviously the engineering team who are responsible for both implementing the different features and instrumentation to measure the experiment. Involving them as early as possible as to the parts of the experience that may vary will help them to build them a flexible framework for A/B testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;bonus-learning-before-i-go&quot;&gt;Bonus learning before I go&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final learning is not about the A/B test method itself, but about people we design for that came from these variant tests: there’s nothing wrong with providing guidance. I don’t really like the term “user education” or “onboarding” because it is a little condescending (the implication is that the onus is on people to learn how to get on board with this awesome product). User onboarding is actually an opportunity for us as designers to provide persuasive and clear communication, explaining to our newcomer editors what the value is for them to make contributions to Wikipedia in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-wikifunctions&quot;&gt;What is Wikifunctions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikifunctions will be a collaboratively edited multilingual library of functions. It will be the first platform The Wikimedia Foundation launches since &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikidata&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, and part of a bigger vision towards an Abstract Wikipedia, which you can read about at &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Abstract Wikipedia on meta-wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-function-and-its-parts&quot;&gt;A function and its parts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a programmer you might not be familiar with what a function needs to be usable, or to use technical-speak “to run”. A function takes an input (e.g. the population of a city) and provides an output (e.g. the acres of watershed needed to supply residents with water). It can do this calculation over and over again for different cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function has three parts. The function definition (part 1), the implementation (part 2), and a test (part 3) to validate. These three components – the definition, implementation, and tests – are what a function needs to perform and be usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A definition defines the functions behavior. What type of inputs does it accept? How many? What will it output? An implementation is the set of instructions that transforms an input into an output. A test is what validates the implementation and ensures it performs correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-functions-do&quot;&gt;What can functions do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, you might use a function to wake up in the morning. Let’s say you want to sleep 8 hours tonight, you could ask a function, &lt;em&gt;“If I go to sleep at 10 P.M. what time should I wake up to get 8 hours of sleep?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions are ubiquitous in modern life, from the apps we use daily (e.g. maps and search) to the analyses made by scientists, doctors, journalists, and financial advisors, functions enable our activities by efficiently and precisely making meaning through calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions will provide the code that translates language-independent articles from Abstract Wikipedia into natural language Wikipedia articles. This will theoretically allow more people to share more knowledge in more languages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This blog post is about how to create, view, and edit functions in Wikifunctions, and the design process behind making this happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;our-audience&quot;&gt;Our audience&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to other Wikimedia projects, our hope and aim is for Wikifunctions to be inviting, accessible to, and available to all people across the world. This is why we are designing a &lt;strong&gt;multilingual platform that is mobile friendly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several roles for people within the Wikifunctions ecosystem. There are “answer seekers”, or people who simply want to learn about functions and use them. A level deeper are those who edit or materially contribute to Wikifunctions in some capacity. They could be function patrollers, programmers who write implementations, translators, admins who approve of proposed implementations and tests, or test writers who QA implementations. These folks will maintain functions and documentation. Among these editors there will be technical and nontechnical folks. Leading up to launch and post-launch, &lt;strong&gt;our team aims to increase the agency of the nontechnical folks and “junior” techies&lt;/strong&gt; by creating pathways for them to contribute meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of creating these pathways is simplifying a complicated process. Functions are not simple. They are complex in that they require computational thinking and well-written documentation. When designing the creation experience, our objective was to design an editor interface that looks and feels friendly to nontechnical people and radically simplifies a complex process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;our-approach&quot;&gt;Our approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explored different mental models for Wikifunctions such as collaborative coding, a structured Q&amp;amp;A forum, a homework helper, infrastructure for Abstract Wikipedia, and a ‘generic library of functions’. &lt;strong&gt;We settled on the structured Q&amp;amp;A model, where we conceive of functions as tools which can answer structured questions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikifunctions/our-approach.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our approach&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WMF’s mission is to unlock knowledge and help all people share in it, freely. The Abstract Wikipedia team believes that functions can play a key role in unlocking knowledge, and sees Wikifunctions as a crucial player in moving all of us towards this mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a source of power to know how to write and use functions. It gives the person the power of knowledge creation. Our objective when designing the function creation experience was to make it as friendly, intuitive, and simple as possible so that more people can have access to this power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-design-principles&quot;&gt;Our design principles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conceptual simplicity: Given the complex nature of this project, our team aims to radically simplify the concepts involved so that we might be inclusive of all people, especially those who are less familiar with functions, code, natural language processing, or lexicographic knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intuitive interface: We want to build a system with a shallow onramp, one that anyone can figure out and engage with in meaningful ways. We wish for there to be little gap between a newcomer’s existing knowledge (i.e. current knowledge) and the knowledge they need to operate the product (i.e. target knowledge). Our interface will provide community members with an uninterrupted experience, where they are well-supported to complete tasks with relative ease and confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multilingual: In a world where all people can share in the sum of all knowledge, it is critical that Wikimedia products are designed as multilingual interfaces and experiences. From the beginning, the Abstract Wikipedia team will prioritize designing for and testing in the native languages of our community-members. Our objective is to move at the speed of trust with all populations, but especially with small Wikis and underrepresented groups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balance: We wish to acknowledge that many of our community members will be veterans of Wikipedia, Wikidata, or any of the movement’s other projects. Many of them will be highly-skilled at navigating technical interfaces and desire customizability similar to Wikipedia or other open source projects. The challenge before us is prioritizing the needs of non-programmers and those with little-to-no coding experience while keeping in mind the expectations of veterans. This will require flexibility and openness in our designs, and filtering design decisions through multiple lenses in order to ensure that we are not locked into any one particular user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-have-implemented-these-principles-by-doing-the-following&quot;&gt;We have implemented these principles by doing the following:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intentionally minimizing the use of technical jargon and providing a glossary of terms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing tooltips and informative microcopy on every interface&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focused attention on information hierarchy so as not to overwhelm users with information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User testing with nontechnical people and iterating to meet their needs and expectations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User testing with technical people to ensure we are not causing irritation or creating unnecessary roadblocks to their progress
-Multilingual design and usability testing (testing is in the planning process)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-use-wikifunctions&quot;&gt;How to use Wikifunctions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-function&quot;&gt;Creating a function&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we wanted to create a function that determined if two words rhymed. The “two words” are two inputs of type &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;, and the output is a single “yes or no”, which is a type &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boolean&lt;/a&gt;. To create a function that could do this, we would need to tell the system, “Hey this function &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;accepts two inputs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, both have to be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;strings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and the function’s output will be a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boolean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This process is known as “defining” the function, and it is the first step in creating a function.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team believes that the UI and UX for defining a function must be as inclusive as possible because, technically, anyone can do it. It requires no coding or composition writing. Defining a function can be thought of as a request: &lt;em&gt;“Hey I want a function that does X”&lt;/em&gt; translates to &lt;em&gt;“the function accepts this input, returns this output”&lt;/em&gt;. We also provide a way to add documentation so that the user can further explain what they’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-challenge-1-the-function-editor&quot;&gt;Design challenge 1: The function editor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We initially planned to design a “function editor” that provided an end-to-end experience, meaning users could define, implement, and test in one environment. Since we were designing for &lt;strong&gt;technical and nontechnical people&lt;/strong&gt;, we hypothesized that unifying the experience would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simplify the concept of what a function needs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide a contextual experience which would be helpful for nontechnical users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep related tasks together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow more senior editors to move in and out of the process as they pleased&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not slow down the technical audience from using the editor as they wanted, while providing guardrails for nontechnical users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early drafts and variations of an end-to-end function editor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikifunctions/early-draft03.png&quot; alt=&quot;Early draft 3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UX was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/tags/miro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/figma&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wd-query-builder.toolforge.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Wikidata query builder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/tags/typeform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Typeform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pivoting –&lt;/strong&gt; we tested these mockups with technical non-Wikimedians and Wikimedians, and the results were overwhelmingly positive. However, as our developers were building this design, &lt;strong&gt;we realized that the underlying design of the system was incompatible with this approach.&lt;/strong&gt; Function definitions, implementations, and tests are all separate objects in Wikifunctions, and each object can refer to other objects within it, such as data types (e.g. strings, Booleans, or other functions). &lt;strong&gt;Due to the complexity allowed for each object, we decided it’s best to keep each creation experience separate.&lt;/strong&gt; Objects also have their own pages, so any object you create automatically publishes as a Page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the function editor is a place only for defining the function, in other words part one of creating a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-challenge-2-a-function-page&quot;&gt;Design challenge 2: A function page&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you publish a function that you’ve defined, it is saved and published as a function page. &lt;strong&gt;This is the page where all parts of a function live.&lt;/strong&gt; We framed this page as an entry point for the community to learn about, use, and/or edit a function. The goal of this page is to help people progressively edit a function or simply engage with one. The challenge of this page, and a Wikifunctions motif, is that the page must appeal to both non-technical and technical people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-short-term-goals-were-to&quot;&gt;Our short term goals were to&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help all users &lt;strong&gt;UNDERSTAND&lt;/strong&gt; the function so that they can edit or use it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENCOURAGE&lt;/strong&gt; users with coding backgrounds to make technical contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENCOURAGE&lt;/strong&gt; users who are not coders to make non-technical contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Usability test a Figma prototype of the product solution with people who have a strong coding background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-hopes-and-dreams-were-to&quot;&gt;Our hopes and dreams were to&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage everyone that views a function to try using it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support coders who want to make technical contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage users who don’t code to make non-technical contributions because functions need names, aliases, translations of the name/input labels, and documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-aimed-to-avoid&quot;&gt;We aimed to avoid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confusing, discouraging, overwhelming, or intimidating non-coders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unintentionally signaling to non-coders that this isn’t a space for them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Irritating coders by slowing them down or hiding important actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function page as it currently exists today. A user lands on a function page’s ‘About’ tab and can toggle between ‘About’ and ‘Details’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikifunctions/function-page.png&quot; alt=&quot;function page&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A user can learn more about the technical details of the function on the ‘Details’ tab, such as how many available implementations and verified testers it has, and what the definition is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;prologue&quot;&gt;Prologue&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the discussion page about Nellie Bly’s article, communication isn’t the easiest in normal circumstances. You have to hunt for, and then decipher, little clues scattered around the page to initiate a conversation, and then navigate a confusing interface with seemingly-arcane glyphs to orient yourself in the conversation, all while trying to write what you actually came to discuss. A few months back, I wanted to add a photo of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nellie_Bly_-_The_Girl_Puzzle.jpg?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Girl Puzzle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a monument which is located on Roosevelt Island, New York that memorializes Nellie Bly. I think that this image will show how revered she still is for her journalistic work and, since there are very few images of her, it is a nice representation of her likeness. I walk to the monument on the north edge of this island situated within the center of Manhattan, take a photo and prepare to post it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt; so that it can be linked and posted on the Wikipedia article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I got stuck. Am I allowed to post this? Are there copyright issues? I visited the discussion page on the English Wikipedia and tried to start a new topic. It’s not easy, but ultimately I realized that I needed to click the “add new section” tab in the interface and ask about inserting the image into the article. After some conversation I wrote &lt;em&gt;“I can take a photo, but would that make it alright to post it or do I need to get approval from the artist?”&lt;/em&gt; I didn’t know the rules around image rights. I magically got responses from other contributors, but I didn’t even notice that they wrote back to me until a month later when I checked the page. Eventually, I’m guided to a number of different policy pages, and from these I figured out that the best way to get the image up is to get an appropriately licensed photo from the monument’s owners, and then go back to the article to post the image and its associated information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its own, figuring out the best way to get and include an image on the article was painful, but figuring that out while trying to navigate the obscure conventions for using the discussion interface, now that was excruciating. On-wiki communication has gotten a lot better for me personally over time because I have at my disposal colleagues and long-term contributors who I actually know and can help me to learn. That’s great, but for others it has not gone so well; potential contributors just give up. They just stop trying. By their thousands. The Editing Team set out to make moments like this less painful, so that as a contributor, you can just focus on the point that you are trying to get across and improve the encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;making-easier-to-use-tools&quot;&gt;Making easier-to-use tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/03/10/people-are-talking.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first installment&lt;/a&gt; in this series, I shared how we in the Editing Team conducted research and collaborated with community members to identify a design strategy for the project. The heart of our strategy involves us diving deeply into the asynchronous collaboration experience. To do this, our approach is to first make it easier for contributors to use the tools and then, when we have confirmed that the tools are useful, follow that up by making it easier for folks to discover them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We undertook a virtual “listening tour”, where we heard from contributors with a variety of experience levels on Talk Pages share what their interactions there were like. From this, we identified four initial opportunities to improve the Talk Page experience that I will walk you through today. Our hypothesis was that addressing these problems would mean that contributors have a more positive and productive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-1-theres-no-clear-way-to-engage&quot;&gt;Problem 1: There’s no clear way to engage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at this discussion page here, you can see that it’s very challenging to identify what to even click to reply to these discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/edit-link.png&quot; alt=&quot;The way to reply to comments currently is to click an “edit” link.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The way to reply to comments currently is to click an “edit” link.
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to click the “edit” button to reply. Not obvious. What you’d expect here is a clear call to action, something that says “reply” on it that you can press and initiate the workflow for writing back to someone in a conversation. So that’s what we did. We made a minimal, non-invasive change, which was to add inline links with a more obvious word: “Reply”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/reply-link.png&quot; alt=&quot;Using words that readers expect to see in discussion spaces such as “reply”  as calls to action can be helpful.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Using words that readers expect to see in discussion spaces such as “reply”  as calls to action can be helpful.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this one change seems simple, it was hugely technically challenging to implement within the constraints that the Wikipedia software gives us. Previous approaches had been hamstrung, either by making trivial systems that don’t work for all the hundreds of language communities that are already part of the Wikimedia movement, or by trying to replace discussion pages and all the functionalities that our communities have built into them over the decades that Wikimedia has been going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Principal Engineer Ed Sanders puts it, “Existing wikitext talk pages are completely unstructured. That means that all the information is thrown together in what we’ve been calling a wikitext soup. And while humans may be able to parse it out by looking at the structure of the conversation, it’s not easy for the software to do this.” For us to extract useful information from the page we needed to build a new tool which we called the Comment Parser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Comment Parser works by breaking up that flat page into structured data. There are lots of edge cases to consider here: hundreds of timestamp formats, multi-line comments with mixed indentation, strange username links. By rolling this out slowly to different communities we’ve been able to identify more edge cases and improve the accuracy of the parser. It helps us to know where comments start and end so we can add the individual reply links to conversations. It also allows us to insert your reply in the correct place with the correct amount of indentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who had used the Structured Discussions system, a key difference is this implementation approach is that, according to Ed, “all the information is &lt;strong&gt;extracted from the page, and not the tool,&lt;/strong&gt; so we can apply this insight to edits made with the full page editor.” The Editing Team’s Product Manager noted that “a key requirement when we spoke to the community was compatibility with existing workflows, so being agnostic about which editor was used means we can do things like show notifications regardless of what editing interface people are using to trigger them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-2-the-interface-for-writing-is-confusing&quot;&gt;Problem 2: The interface for writing is confusing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the reply button, you now have a nice entry point into the workflow. That said, actually writing a reply was still confusing for a handful of reasons, including the fact that there’s manual threading, the ability to edit other people’s comments by accident, edit-centric language, and you needed to know the wikitext conventions for signing and dating your posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/sign-name.png&quot; alt=&quot;To sign your name and add a date you need to write four tildas “~~~~”&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;To sign your name and add a date you need to write four tildas “~~~~”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same problems also applied to starting new topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/new-topics.png&quot; alt=&quot;Having to add basic contact information via wikitext isn’t intuitive to most contributors.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Having to add basic contact information via wikitext isn’t intuitive to most contributors.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We addressed this by making it possible to reply and sign your name automatically. This alone would have made a huge difference, because it’s frankly a real pain to have to write “ ~~~~ “ after every single post. We built upon this moment to reduce the complexity of mentioning another Wikipedian, formatting your response, and identifying your comment in the discussion. Again, we made this change inline and more contextual, so that it just felt like an organic conversation experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For adding new topics we made a similar, more obvious workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/new-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;Point, click, type and add:the new design for adding new topics. &quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-3-missing-notifications&quot;&gt;Problem 3: Missing Notifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a contributor, you were now in the situation where you could start and reply to topics, but in terms of getting notified if someone replied to you, well you got nothing, unless that person knew to use one of the many user-generated templates to @-mention you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact it was even worse than nothing – you would sometimes get a small amount of notifications based on a  set of rules so confusing that you’d have no idea if the other person is getting notified. So, we fixed this with a series of iterations on notifications. We created topic subscriptions, so you can choose if and how you want to be informed about activity within the conversation that you are in. If you’ve used the Structured Discussions tool, you’ll be familiar with these, but you will now get notifications for normal talk page edits, even if the other contributor isn’t using our tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we validated the effectiveness of that feature, we heard from contributors that there are just some conversations that they want to be automatically added to, so that’s what we’ve been working on recently. We have the technology in place and are still checking with test users to ensure that the tools aren’t over-communicating to contributors in such a way that it feels noisy and unwelcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/subscribe-link.png&quot; alt=&quot;Subscribing you to a particular topic will give you timely updates about discussions that you deem important.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-4-talk-pages-look-like-articles&quot;&gt;Problem 4: Talk pages look like articles.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English there’s a metaphorical idiom of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the elephant in the room&lt;/a&gt;,” which means that there’s something very important that needs to be discussed but it’s probably going to be a little awkward to talk about it. For talk pages, that elephant is the fact that article pages look very similar to talk pages, and it confuses people who are new to the concept of a talk page. Headings are the same, the table of contents is the same, and there’s no other indication that this is a place where people can have conversations. This is where we are now. We are beginning to explore ways to make it more obvious what this page is all about by emphasizing elements on the page so that you can easily see what conversations are active, who is talking in them, and how you can get involved in them. This will be addressed in a future release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve heard a lot of positive feedback about these improvements. Here are some nice quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…I like the fact that it’s very stripped down and doesn’t feel data intense… The colors are pleasing to the eye. Simple to navigate interface. Overall, it works the way I’d expect it to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Usability Test Participant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think this is the best new feature since years and finally an approach to simplify discussion pages without breaking the workflow of experienced users. So thank you very much for your effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;User:Hgzh,&lt;/strong&gt; German Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feedback is crucial to the success of these tools. Peter explained that “As a fundamentally social and community-driven project, conversation is a core part of Wikipedia. It is a core practice that shapes Wikipedia’s policies, culture and ultimately, the knowledge that is and is NOT represented within it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want testers and skeptics to try these tools out so that I can refine and if necessary rethink the design proposal. What’s particularly great about having a beta release channel is that it offers an opportunity to get things wrong and then quickly throw up a new proposal for review. Try out the tools yourself by going into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Beta_Features?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; or global preferences and turning on Discussions Tools. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk_pages_project?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Let us know what you think&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a discussion, afterall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;epilogue&quot;&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the help of the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, I was successfully able to add the image of The Girl Puzzle to &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nellie_Bly_-_The_Girl_Puzzle.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Bly?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diverse teams generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;perform better than others&lt;/a&gt;, but what do we mean by diversity and how do we know what diversity exists within our own teams?  Most people consider diversity to be things like gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic identity, religion, languages spoken, age, educational background, etc. and ultimately everyone has multiple facets to their identity that make them who they are, but some of these facets are not always visible in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month my colleague and I organised and facilitated our annual three-day virtual offsite, for our global team of 25 designers and researchers. Across the team we span multiple timezones and continents and are a very global team geographically, but we are also an entirely English-language speaking team, grounded in many of the cultural norms of American society, where the Wikimedia Foundations headquarters are based. So we decided to focus the offsite on an overarching theme of ‘communication,’ with a particular focus on understanding a little more about each person’s cultural background and the role communication played in this for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-idea&quot;&gt;The idea&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We surveyed the team to find out what languages everyone spoke, and what each person’s native language was. We discovered that almost half the team had NOT learnt English as their first language. It occurred to me then that if we could actually hear every person in the team, speak about themselves in their native language, we may experience something quite different about each other. What if we hired translators to translate team members speaking in their first language?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to be sure that people were encouraged to open up as much or as little as they felt comfortable doing in this context. We were aware that for some people speaking about themselves in a large group can feel quite intimidating, and different people have different levels of personal information they want to share in a work environment. So I thought that perhaps adding a level of abstraction to the conversation might ease this tension. We decided to ask folks to describe themselves through a set of ‘artifacts’ or ‘objects’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the session we asked each person to spend some time identifying and thinking about some objects in their lives that had significance for them. What did they mean to them personally, and what did they say about who they were? They prepared for the activity by following these guidelines;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify a set of three ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artifact&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;’ (or objects) that show…&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Something that represents different aspects of your &lt;strong&gt;personality&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Something that represents the &lt;strong&gt;culture(s)&lt;/strong&gt; you most closely associate with.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Something that represents the &lt;strong&gt;method of communication&lt;/strong&gt; that makes you feel most alive.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take photos or download images of your artifacts and add them to a shared slide deck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepare to talk for 2 minutes about your artifacts and why you chose them, in your native language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;activity&quot;&gt;Activity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hired seven translators to join the online event and translate the talks, sentence-by-sentence, from Hindi, Cantonese, German, French, Italian, Russian and Spanish back into English for the team. As the activity flowed I could see the faces of the team lit up with intrigue and curiosity as they discovered a whole new side to their teammates. As one person later said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Hearing my colleagues speak in their native language was like meeting new people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were highly creative in how they interpreted the activity and chose fascinating objects to describe themselves. For example, one person showed a picture of a digital watch to describe their personality whilst another showed a tent hung between two trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/surfacing-embracing-diversity/watch-tent.png&quot; alt=&quot;Digital watch to describe their personality whilst another showed a tent hung between two trees.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people chose very similar objects to describe their culture, often when they in fact came from quite different backgrounds. For example, a couple of people chose stones and objects from nature, whilst two showed pictures of their bikes, and two others shared bottles of olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/surfacing-embracing-diversity/nature-objects.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stones and objects from nature, whilst two showed pictures of their bikes, and two others shared bottles of olive oil.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people chose music as the method of communication that makes them feel most alive.  Perhaps we should have a team playlist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;learnings&quot;&gt;Learnings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of translating the talks wasn’t easy, given the fact that many of the people in the team actually spoke better English than some of the professional translators we had hired. This meant that when a few of the translations appeared not to be entirely accurate, some of the people doing their talks, felt the need to briefly re-explain what had been said in English.  As one of the participants said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Listening to translators on the first day, especially when it was evident there was missed or incorrect interpretation. It really highlighted the invisible communication issues we face as designers and researchers working on a multilingual product with people from around the world, and the importance of reviewing text, written, speech, and visual communications as there is so much room for (mis)interpretation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this whole process was very interesting to observe and felt like as much part of the experience as the talking was. As the challenges of speaking and translating different languages became evident throughout the exercise, one participant observed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Hearing fellow team members presenting in their native languages was a lovely moment that made me appreciate what a global team we have and also full of admiration of how so many people communicate so eloquently in English when it’s their second language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was something about this experience that allowed us all to connect on a different level. One person said to me that no-one had ever asked them to speak their native language at work before. By seeing the different facets of each other and starting to form new types of connections, we began to see how our different views and perspectives actually bring us together and make us stronger as a team. And in turn, this will lay the foundations for being able to work on more complex problems together and ultimately build even better products. As one of my colleagues so beautifully put it;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“All the moments of hearing my multi-cultural team speaking in different languages was such a beautiful sound and an aural reminder of our diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve shared this story today in the hopes that it may inspire others to run a similar activity in their own teams. If you do, please share your experience, we would love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">An activity to speak your native language.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/assets/uploads/surfacing-embracing-diversity/header.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/assets/uploads/surfacing-embracing-diversity/header.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Understanding the Wiki Communications and Mentorship Ecosystems</title><link href="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/20/understanding-the-wiki-communications-and-mentorship-ecosystems.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Understanding the Wiki Communications and Mentorship Ecosystems" /><published>2021-12-20T07:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-20T07:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/20/understanding-the-wiki-communications-and-mentorship-ecosystems</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/20/understanding-the-wiki-communications-and-mentorship-ecosystems.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dchen@wikimedia.org&quot;&gt;Daisy Chen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Wikimedia Foundation’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Growth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Growth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Editing_team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Editing&lt;/a&gt; teams were respectively making plans and progress on Newcomer features and Talk Pages in recent quarters, the teams were curious about where and how wiki users are communicating with one another, and how mentorship manifests within the communication ecosystem. As a first step in this process, &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/strategy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Product Design Strategy&lt;/a&gt; completed an initial round of research with a participant cohort of primarily affiliate group members, Foundation staff, and other long-time volunteers to illuminate the communications/mentorship ecosystem and identify areas of potential future study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-we-wanted-to-learn&quot;&gt;What we wanted to learn&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Growth and Editing teams wanted to keep the research and discovery process open-ended, they both had some goals in mind for their respective teams’ work. The Growth team hoped the research outcomes would inform the mentorship and collaboration opportunities being tested in the Newcomer program initiatives. The Editing team wanted to understand use cases, benefits and impacts of various communication channels being utilized and how that might feed their work on Talk Pages and New Discussion Tool. Both teams felt this research would impact ongoing work and future plans around communication features/support and mentorship/collaboration opportunities, and we jointly created a couple grounding sets of research questions to that end:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communications&quot;&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the various communication tools used by different communities to have these discussions?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What types of work are done on these channels?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do community members communicate besides on wiki (ie., besides Talk pages, Village Pump, etc) across different language wikis?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the motivations for using on and/vs off wiki channels? What are the benefits and tradeoffs of each?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are these tools used instead/as well, and what are their efficacies as effective/positive communication tools?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mentorship&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is mentorship defined? What does it look like on the ground?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What factors influence mentorship motivation? How can users be encouraged to mentor others, and see their impacts?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How has/does communicating with other contributors affect newcomers’ understanding of Wikipedia as a community of people working together and their connection to it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the efficacy of the off wiki channels specifically in attracting and fostering new contributors?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can productivity tools that promote collaborative editing/communication/tracking, potentially integrated on wiki, also affect mentorship effectiveness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;our-research-participants-and-process&quot;&gt;Our research participants and process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To contain the scope of this initial round of research (with a second round envisioned to expand our research into other segments), we decided to keep our first participant cohort to those who have had more experience working in the various wiki communities. These folks worked in a wide range of wiki-related roles both in various organizational and volunteer capacities; the goal was to hear about their communications and mentorship experiences at length. Interviews were conducted in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few target languages/regions came into focus after reviewing geographic areas of interest the Growth and Editing teams pinpointed and where ongoing recruitment of potential participants seemed to be proving most fruitful. Ultimately, the participants were determined after evaluating languages, regions and genders represented, and diversity of roles within the wiki movement, among other factors. The languages/regions in particular were determined when we were able to establish a ‘critical mass’ of sorts, where we spoke with enough participants in each to start observing patterns in their responses and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We concluded the project with 18 participant interviews across 4 primary geographic regions. Each of the interviews were semi-structured, with a prepared discussion guide to provide a basic framework for the exploration while allowing for the participants to freely express both directly and tangentially relevant experiences and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-did-we-discover-in-these-conversations&quot;&gt;What did we discover in these conversations?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communications-1&quot;&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devices and access.&lt;/strong&gt; Even given the characteristics of this cohort (juggling a wide range of audiences and channels both on and off wiki, high volume of communication, high relative access to digital resources), none of the participants indicated that they used their mobile as a primary device for their communications. Many indicated that laptop/desktop access made many tasks easier to accomplish as some on wiki tasks are not yet mobile-friendly or lack appropriate functionality (in addition to inherent screen and device limitations). Laptop/desktop use was also convenient as many classically mobile tasks (texting, sending images, calling) are increasingly available from a desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/devices-used.png&quot; alt=&quot;Devices used to communicate for wiki work.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this is the direct finding from this cohort, many from the cohort broached the issue that many existing and potential users, especially from the Southeast Asia and South Asia (India) regions, are facing device/digital resource limitations. They may face inconsistent internet infrastructure/access, limited/expensive data, and limited access to devices (no/shared access to a singular mobile device, paid entry to internet cafes with device access). To address this, optimizing our mobile experience in terms of accessibility/reliability and additional features while limiting bandwidth used where possible is key to reaching this audience further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On or off wiki communication?&lt;/strong&gt; This cohort bucked expectations again here; even though their wiki communication is heavily due to a wiki-related role/obligation and their individual capacities as volunteers, they tended to do most of the communication off the wikis. Those who utilized on-wiki communications more often indicated they did so primarily for posting official updates and documenting conversations and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants often strategically move conversations between on and off wiki channels, most specifically moving discussions to off wiki channels and then returning on wiki to document the outcomes and decisions from those discussions. The reasons given for moving discussions off wiki included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;expediency (having the discussions was logistically quicker to do on off wiki channels)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wider reach/more inclusive (more people quantitatively in general and more were engaged in the conversation than on on wiki alternative arenas)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more availability for private or otherwise sensitive conversation as needed (everything on wiki is visible for anyone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, many participants empathetically said that being on wiki is a “disadvantage” and an “inequality”, especially for newer users. The learning curve overall, the invisibility of accessing help and finding communication channels, understanding the norms of communication in each wiki community – all contribute to why the cohort as a rule tends to try and meet newer users where they are, which is most often an off wiki channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/where-participants-communicate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Where do our participants communicate.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;“The more time you put in off wiki, the less time you need to defend it on meta&quot;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;On and off wiki channels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Below you’ll find examples of channels being used both on and off wiki, an approximated scorecard of the pros and cons of the two main options, and basic flow charts of the most common use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt; off wiki channels score higher on all listed criteria for our participants and provide the most helpful outcomes when it comes to the tasks and connections they need to make in their wiki work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off wiki channels as a whole offer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quicker responses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more casual feel that can lead to more sincere communication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;option for private conversations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;better accessibility and mobile/UI-friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where does off wiki communication fall short as a category? The regard for on wiki legitimacy remains; it is a must for announcements, recording of important decisions and outcomes, and everything posted is public, documentable, and referenceable. The transparency and accountability on off wiki options are not as clear cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do participants think could improve communication?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The participant suggestions below are charted on a continuum of simple to execute (left/green) to the more complex (right/red). They are also sorted into suggestions that could impact communications more directly (top half) and changes that have more of an indirect impact (bottom half).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mentorship-1&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentorship as described by many participants is transactional and editing-centric. A few members of this cohort, while tackling task-based, editing-focused questions, have also emphasized and lived the importance of additional facets of a mentorship relationship. Moving forward, we should support a tailored approach to mentorship, one that spans the transactional/functional (knowing what/how to do) to the institutional/inspirational (understanding of the movement, engagement borne of interest, belonging and recognition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We need longevity and sustainability from good mentorship. Do we want 1 person who edits 100 times or get 10 people to do 10 edits each?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this framework, we’ll also need to address our users’ varying needs. While facilitating “human-powered” means of mentorship interactions, we should also take care to supplement learning with technical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Examples of mentorship and their impacts and frequencies, charted&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answering questions about editing tasks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This could be on a one-off or an ongoing basis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specific, targeted Commons photo advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A participant brought up this example; this individual received specific, actionable feedback on why photos were not being approved and what it would take for a photo to be approved and even featured&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating and disseminating tutorial type materials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holding editing-focused workshops and events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaching about the movement and opportunities;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. Making mentees aware of the larger movement, organizational structures, and providing advice on mentees’ draft proposals for their own projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Involving people in a hobby-based campaign;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. The Wiki Loves Butterfly initiative involved finding butterfly enthusiasts on social media, motivating them to join wiki, having 1:1 chats with them and meeting in person, showing them commons/uploading/categories and other editing-related tasks, doing/coordinating fieldwork and taking butterfly lifecycle photos, holding photo workshops etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constant communication and community;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. Wiki World Heritage User Group holds workshops and is in constant communication/collaboration. Its engagement plan also includes a skills assessment in which members and newcomers are asked about knowledge on various topics/tools, and where they’d like to learn more. This is used to match people up, invite them to specific topic/tool discussions or sessions, or set up curriculum for planned workshops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do participants think could improve mentorship?&lt;/strong&gt; There is some overlap in suggested solutions here, particularly the suggestion for forum-style, centralized discussion interface and for better documentation of various resources and FAQs. Participant suggestions range from simpler (left/green) to the more complex (right/red).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/improve-mentorship.png&quot; alt=&quot;Improving Mentorship.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communications-2&quot;&gt;Communications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some relatively quicker fixes we can make to make our on wiki communications options more accessible, intuitive, and visible to our community, especially on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a higher level, our Product teams need to weigh the pros and cons of making on wiki the go-to place for all wiki-related communications or acknowledge that on wiki is simply not meant to be that type of all-encompassing destination and support off wiki channels where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other general considerations include device and data limitations many of our community members and potential users face, differing cultural tendencies (e.g, security, privacy, building trust) and community-specific norms around policing, attitudes towards newcomers/anonymous users, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mentorship-2&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communications ecosystem’s visibility and functionality are the foundation for mentorship to develop, flourish, and sustain. The functionality aspect should increasingly address not just transactional forms of newcomer help/training (documentation pages, FAQs, bots) but also allow for organic growth of mentorship connections and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When mentorship connections do not arise organically, such as in structured newcomer programs, the resulting mentorship interactions tend to remain more transactional in nature and lack an inspirational element that fosters feelings of ownership and more naturally creates opportunities for challenge/reward dynamics to arise. These are factors that tend to establish additional connections, interests, and overall a more prolonged, lasting relationship with the mentor and the movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next-planning-collaboration-evaluation&quot;&gt;What’s next? Planning, collaboration, evaluation.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prioritization and planning current/future roadmap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The findings inform ways (and focus areas) in which our Growth team’s Newcomer homepage/tasks initiatives can be improved and supplemented with concurrent efforts. The team can focus on ideation, prioritization, and planning for features in upcoming quarters/annual plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scoping &amp;amp; cross-team collaboration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Other Foundation teams may find this work relevant in their focus areas, both in and outside of Product. There are opportunities for the Growth team to coordinate with other teams (e.g. Editing, Android &amp;amp; iOS, Trust &amp;amp; Safety) on issues impacting communications and mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytics/UX evaluations of Newcomer initiatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As Growth team’s newcomer initiatives are rolled out on test wikis and perhaps additional wikis, evaluating on an iterative basis how the features are or aren’t meeting the needs of a variety of user personas, using both analytics and usability testing/interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-strategic-research&quot;&gt;Further strategic research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional relevant personas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The next phase of this research should include newcomers and mentees (specific subset of newcomers) more specifically. This will provide first-hand knowledge of how those first experiencing communications related to the wikis become aware of the variety of channels, their expectations and the realities, and their experiences of the newcomer initiatives and interactions with experienced users (in a general or specifically mentorship-type capacity) in these spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specific communities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Further research should include communities with limited device and connectivity and also cultural concerns whereby trust is primarily built through in-person connections to see what support possibilities exist.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Where and how wiki users are communicating with one another, and how mentorship manifests within the communication ecosystem.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/header.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/header.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Wikipedia and Apps: A Love Story</title><link href="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/08/wikipedia-and-apps-a-love-story.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wikipedia and Apps: A Love Story" /><published>2021-12-08T07:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-08T07:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/08/wikipedia-and-apps-a-love-story</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/08/wikipedia-and-apps-a-love-story.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scblr&quot;&gt;Robin Schoenbaechler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/carolynlimadeo&quot;&gt;Carolyn Li-Madeo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/baba786&quot;&gt;Sudhanshu Gautam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Volker_E&quot;&gt;Volker E.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing for mobile apps presents unique challenges and opportunities compared to traditional websites. Mobile apps run natively on a device and have access to system resources that are harder to access within a web based architecture. Key characteristics of apps are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apps are designed to fit with the rest of the operating system. When an app fits in with the rest of the OS, it not only looks and feels more at home, it lowers the users learning curve.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A deep integration with the OS comes with benefits right out of the box, e.g. accessibility, performance, integration with voice assistants or &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/04/26/bringing-wikipedia-to-the-homescreen-on-ios.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;home screen widgets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offline capabilities and often reduced data usage: offline capabilities allow users to consume content from anywhere, even when they are not connected to the internet or connectivity is low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wikimedia Foundation’s apps are an essential piece to meet our &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/design-principles.html#this-is-for-everyone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“this is for everyone” design principle&lt;/a&gt;. Wikimedia apps are designed with the philosophy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobile-first.abookapart.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mobile first&lt;/a&gt; in mind. One of the core principles of mobile first is to embrace the constraints of a mobile environment and with it, prioritize essential information, as there’s simply not enough room for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited connectivity of people in certain areas of the world inspires us to create products that are performant and light on data. When building new features for people using mobile apps, we strive for excellency in user experience and aim to break down complex existing flows and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Wikipedia app on kaiOS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;strategy&quot;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The apps are here to create mobile first experiences&lt;/strong&gt; and are not trying to replace existing desktop or community tools. Through the apps, we aim to meet potential users where they are. We are interested in understanding and addressing barriers of those that have been historically left behind, while not compromising the integrity of the workflows of our long-time users on other platforms. Making participation fit naturally the mobile first lives we live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The apps are a place to experiment.&lt;/strong&gt; Due to development speed, richer capabilities and unique needs of our user base, we are able to experiment. It is on the apps where we think the future of mobile editing will be discovered. Notably, the apps are where we piloted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Suggested_edits#Welcome_to_Suggested_edits&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;micro contributions&lt;/a&gt;, our most successful editing intervention to this date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The apps are a forcing function to make our technologies future proof.&lt;/strong&gt; To provide an example: Right now Wikipedia’s web experience works as a website only and cannot be exported to new mediums. By building on the apps, we create technology that is platform independent and enables next generation experiences. Whether these use artificial intelligence, augmented reality or future technology that is changing our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;theming&quot;&gt;Theming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikipedia-and-apps-a-love-story/theming.png&quot; alt=&quot;Theming.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the introduction, iOS and Android both have platform specific guidelines. When building apps for the global Wikimedia movement, our goal is to create native experiences for the specific platform. When designing for mobile apps, guidelines for the platform sit at the top of the hierarchy. Throughout Wikimedia’s product suite, we follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/visual-style.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Design’s visual design principles&lt;/a&gt; when providing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a seamless and familiar experience within Wikimedia’s products and services, we apply theming that is based on Wikimedia’s visual style guidelines. Theming allows us to customize the app’s look and feel, to better represent our product’s brand. Theming is reflected in the entire UI, including individual components, like buttons. Here’s an example of applying Material Theming in the Wikipedia Android app:&lt;/p&gt;

Since both the Android and iOS Wikipedia app is available in four different reading themes (Light, Sepia, Dark and Black), they are using an enhanced color palette for an optimal reading experience. Check out more details about the color palette for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Android_theme_guidelines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://diff.wikimedia.org/2017/12/04/ios-app-dark-theme/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;

The app’s mostly use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/visual-style_icons.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;icons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; provided by the platform, e.g. from &lt;a href=&quot;hhttps://material.io/design/iconography&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Material&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Apple Human Interface Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, except for icons that are associated with established Wikimedia products or services (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/OOUI_icons#userTalk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia’s icon for user talk pages&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How clear is the goal? Based on Wikimedia Design’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/design-principles.html#content-first&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“content first” principle&lt;/a&gt;, we aim to &lt;strong&gt;design apps that are easy to understand and focus on the essential&lt;/strong&gt;. When designing, content comes first, control comes second. On mobile, screen real estate is limited, places of usage are unforeseeable and the user’s focus is reduced. We strive to reduce information density while not neglecting an interface’s functional essence. Guiding questions like: What is the essence of this feature? What is the purpose of this particular screen? How much information can be deprioritized (or left out) to convey a UI’s purpose? Clarity stands for designing user interfaces with clear call to actions, generous use of white space, accessible contrast and hierarchy when designing with type or icons. Writing concise and suitable multilingual UI copy supports in reaching their goals more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where am I? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/design-principles.html#design-for-consistency&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Design for consistency and orientation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are key aspects to help users navigate through an interface in a mobile app. We put explicit effort in communicating where users are and where they can go. Spatial awareness in a digital product helps users in achieving goals more directly. This is exemplified by using a consistent navigation, usage of depth and the application of motion. Deliberate usage of animation and transitions help users navigate an interface. Visual layers and realistic motion convey hierarchy, emotion and understanding when using a device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the design feel on an emotional level? An often forgotten and invisible theme but yet one of the most impactful: emotional design. Along the lines of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/design-principles.html#trustworthy-yet-joyful&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;”trustworthy yet joyful” design principle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;we believe that preserving the human touch and showing ourselves with our values in our work is essential&lt;/strong&gt;. Especially on a device that is as personal as your mobile phone. Instead of creating one more cheap and fast mass feature, we follow a philosophy that has been paved by artists, designers, and architects of the arts and crafts movement. After all, we design for humans and strive to create humane and emotional experiences. Through design, we can see and connect with other human beings. To design experiences that are emotional, we consider understanding the needs of the people we are designing for, as the core mission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the design feel in my hand? &lt;strong&gt;Ergonomics, posture, context, and the tactile nature of touch have implications on how users interact with a design&lt;/strong&gt;. Our design principle “this is for everyone” is part of our core mission and designing for touch is different than designing for a keyboard, mouse or trackpad. When designing for apps, we embrace principles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;direct manipulation&lt;/a&gt;, an interaction model where effect are immediately visible on the screen to the user. Designing for a touch device goes beyond enlarging buttons for bigger fingers. We deeply consider placement and positioning of elements to achieve an ergonomic user experience while being aware of different device usage types. And, as voice is considered as the most natural machine-human input method available, we make sure the interface reflects it. We design experiences that provide ergonomics on smartphones, tablets and hybrid laptop/touch devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On most Wikipedias, you don’t need an account to make an edit. While there are benefits to making an account — such as a single place to see all communications, or a place to store articles that you’re interested in — there is no requirement to make one. This reduced barrier to entry means that people around the world can contribute to our projects — whether it’s a small typo fix or a new article — without ever having to make an account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it also means that it’s easier to vandalize and make destructive edits to our projects. To counter this, our editors and administrators patrol edits made by registered and unregistered editors alike. These watchful editors are also known as &lt;em&gt;patrollers&lt;/em&gt;. To keep out bad faith edits from our projects, patrollers need to have an understanding of who is making the edits. In the case of unregistered editors though, the information that they rely on most is their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An IP address is a unique address that is given to any device that is connected to a network like the Internet. When an unregistered user makes an edit, the change isn’t attributed to their name, but their device’s IP address instead. An IP address is like a home address, it cannot reveal your identity but one can deduce a lot about you by knowing where you live. So, what might seem to some as an &lt;em&gt;anonymous&lt;/em&gt; way of editing actually reveals more about them than a simple pseudonym would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrollers copy these IP addresses into external &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WHOIS tools&lt;/a&gt; to understand where the editor is coming from. These tools tell them information about where the editor might be and how they’re connecting to the Internet. To reduce the extra step of copy-pasting addresses, and providing a single place to get IP  information, the Anti-Harassment Tools team started work on an &lt;em&gt;IPInfo&lt;/em&gt; tool within Wikipedia. This tool would give our patrollers the needed information right where they need it — when analyzing an unregistered user’s contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;designing-ip-info&quot;&gt;Designing IP Info&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-research&quot;&gt;Initial Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we wanted to get a better understanding of the patrolling process and specifically how IP addresses are used while evaluating edits. To do this we conducted interviews with editors who often patrol our projects and asked them to show and talk us through their process. This gave us an overview of the different ways patrollers go about keeping our projects vandalism free. After a few rounds of feedback from design, research, engineers and Trust &amp;amp; Safety folks we had the following task model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/patrolling-unregistered-editors-on-wikipedia/ip-info-risk-vs-usefulness-matrix-wikimedia-design.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Task model for IP Patrolling on wikis.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Task model for IP Patrolling on wikis. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lmUSH8s=/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt; for a full view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand now that IP patrolling usually starts from RecentChanges, an editor’s Watchlist, or from a page that the editor knows gets vandalized often. When looking at the edits of such a page the patroller first looks for clear red flags like edit flooding (lots of minor edits in a short amount of time), no edit summary, large deletions etc. They then look for more specific on-wiki information like if the IP has a talk page, if it has ever been blocked, and its global and local contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this initial fact-finding, patrollers decide if an IP is worth looking into further. If it is, they use external tools to find more information about the IP. They’re looking for details  like — location, proxy usage and organization that the IP might be linked to. This process is not completely accurate since different databases have different information on the same IP. Oftentimes, based on the location of the IP and the location of the tool the editors are using, the information provided might vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, based on the information collected, patrollers decide which action would be most appropriate. Again, this decision takes into account various factors like the policies of that wiki, the scale of the collateral damage caused by a range block, consistency in editing patterns, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mock-ups&quot;&gt;Mock-ups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patrollers need on-wiki information about the IP before they decide to investigate it, so, we decided to add a popup that shows block and contribution information. The popup would be accessible by clicking an information icon next to the IP address on pages like RecentChanges, Watchlist and History.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/patrolling-unregistered-editors-on-wikipedia/ip-info-popup-wikimedia-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;The IP Info popup that’ll be accessible from pages like RecentChanges that patrollers monitor for edits.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The IP Info popup that’ll be accessible from pages like RecentChanges that patrollers monitor for edits.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the patroller decides to dig deeper into an IP address by going to their Contributions page, they’ll be able to see a collapsible box that shows more IP related information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/patrolling-unregistered-editors-on-wikipedia/ip-info-box-wikimedia-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;The IP Info box shown on the Contributions page gives detailed information to the patrollers.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The IP Info box shown on the Contributions page gives detailed information to the patrollers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing these mocks internally brought up three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much information is useful?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who should have access to this information?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should some patrollers have access to partial bits of information?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;balancing-needs&quot;&gt;Balancing needs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our projects have a wide variety of contributors and vary in socio-demography, accessibility and motivations. These and other factors were captured in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Knowledge_Gaps_Index/Taxonomy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Knowledge Gap Taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; research, which not only looked at the gaps in Wikipedia’s content but the gaps in the contributors as well. In turn, we reframed our design questions as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How might we make sure that revealing IP information doesn’t put our most marginalized contributors at risk?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How might we ensure that access to information and tools doesn’t become a barrier to contributions for our least technically skilled contributors?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While IP information needs to be available to all, we wanted to make sure that it doesn’t put anyone at risk and it isn’t so technical &amp;amp; overwhelming that it becomes meaningless to most patrollers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;team-workshop&quot;&gt;Team Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anti-Harassment Tools team and the Trust &amp;amp; Safety teams came together for a small workshop to discuss these items. We acknowledged that we want both non-technical and technical users to have easy access to IP information. We also acknowledged that we can’t put our unregistered editors at risk especially because some of the IP information, like location and organization, can potentially help in identifying a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our discussions around accessibility for patrollers we noted questions and concerns around information overload, accuracy of information and false confidence in IP data. We also considered if having IP information more readily available might lead to its misuse. The following clusters began to form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data:&lt;/strong&gt; How might we make sure that people understand the data they’re looking at, and understand its accuracy too?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal information:&lt;/strong&gt; How might we make sure that information is accessible to those who need it, without putting unregistered editors at risk?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agency:&lt;/strong&gt; How might we inform unregistered editors of the data they are leaving traces of and show them ways to protect it (create an account)?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After brainstorming on the questions we started to organize our thoughts in the following manner — we need to balance the concerns of ease of use for patrollers and risk to unregistered editors. To do this we plotted the different pieces of IP information on a graph with Risk on the Y axis and Usefulness to patrolling on the X axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/patrolling-unregistered-editors-on-wikipedia/ip-info-task-model-wikimedia-design.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Task model for IP Patrolling on wikis.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Plotting the different pieces of IP information based on Risk (to editor) and Usefulness (to patroller). See &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lmUSH8s=/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt; for a full view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise was based on the learnings from research as well as the team’s experience. Two clear clusters appeared, the high risk one mostly containing information that could reveal an editor’s location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this, we are planning to show a limited set of information to most users and give access to more sensitive information to only our most trusted users — Administrators and CheckUsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;gathering-feedback&quot;&gt;Gathering feedback&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community-input&quot;&gt;Community input&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing our findings with the community led to some interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:IP_Editing:_Privacy_Enhancement_and_Abuse_Mitigation/IP_Info_feature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conversations and feedback&lt;/a&gt;. Some common themes were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing or deepening the scope of a particular piece of information. IP Information is complex and having more context and data usually helps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding more data sources to get a wider picture of the IP information. This would also help in figuring out if the data being shown is reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specific points about IP ranges and IPv6 addresses and how to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usability-tests&quot;&gt;Usability tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also able to do some usability tests with Patrollers in the community. Overall, the feature was well-received and they liked that they won’t have to rely on external tools in the future. We were given some specific feedback around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The distribution of information between the popup and the box. Some information is more helpful in the popup to decide whether or not to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having more guidance on how to use this information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Showing some of this information on Diff pages so that editors have access to it while comparing revisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation is currently in the works and we’ll be rolling it out to wikis slowly as a BetaFeature, incorporating improvements based on usability testing. We’ll also be implementing feedback mechanisms in the tool so that we can learn more about how people are using the tool.

&lt;p&gt;Reading a Wikipedia article on a feature phone is time consuming. The article about Tiger might take 25-30 minutes to read on a smartphone; alternatively, it would take much longer to read on a feature phone. While smartphones are almost ubiquitous in some parts of the world, over 100M&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-1&quot; id=&quot;ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; people across the globe still use feature phones to connect to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikimedia has significant room to expand in emerging communities where access to inexpensive devices and cheap data is quickly growing. To help people overcome barriers to access free knowledge on our projects and be a trustworthy source of knowledge and information, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Inuka_team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inuka team&lt;/a&gt; at Wikimedia Foundation decided to improve the Wikipedia reading experience on feature phones to accommodate the unique needs and preferences of historically underrepresented users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-the-devices&quot;&gt;About the devices&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KaiOS, a mobile operating system based on HTML5 power these phones. It supports 4G/LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. India is one of the biggest markets for KaiOS, where it powers Jiophone. These phones have limited computing capabilities, small displays, and most actions are performed using a keypad. Their low cost, combined with the ability to use apps like Google, Facebook, Youtube, etc., make them a top choice among first-time internet users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the phone, all actions are presented on a softkey panel linked to physical keys on the keypad. Most actions are performed using center, left, and right hardware keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team started using feature phones to familiarize ourselves with keypad-based interactions, challenges when using apps, impact of limited infrastructure on user experience, and how the Wikipedia reading experience feels. In parallel, we worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hureo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hureo&lt;/a&gt;, a user research firm based in India, to conduct foundational research&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-2&quot; id=&quot;ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with 25 participants in different cities in India. Research aimed to learn about how they used these devices, their motivations to use them, their awareness of Wikipedia, and their experiences reading Wikipedia articles. These are some of the findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smart features, durability, and good battery life at an affordable price are the main reasons to use feature phones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primary usage is social media, entertainment, and look for information online.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wikipedia awareness is low. Informed users use it to read about famous people, entertainment, places to visit, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading a long Wikipedia article on its browser is quite laborious as typing and scrolling is difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participants mentioned that the small font size required extra effort to read, and caused strain on their eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For quick navigation, users wished to have easy access to the table of contents, images, and other parts of articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These insights from our research, combined with our own experiences and frustrations when reading Wikipedia articles on feature phones, indicated that we should try to provide a better reading experience for all of these people. These were the improvements we were interested in testing with users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An onboarding flow to define What Wikipedia is in simple language to users who may or may not have used it before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Brief onboarding to share about Wikipedia, language diversity, and the volume of articles available.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A “quick links panel” to directly access a section of an article, view images, or  read an article in different languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Quick links to access different parts of an article.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of continuous scrolling using the keypad while moving through an article, readers can read clear segments of a Wikipedia article on the small screen one page at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-we-learn&quot;&gt;What did we learn?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the pandemic, conducting remote sessions in India was quite challenging as screen sharing is not directly supported by KaiOS. Luckily, all participants had access to smartphones either through their family members or friends. Twenty participants(12 Male, 8 Females) were recruited within the 20 to 40 years age group. Interviews were conducted in English, Hindi, Marathi, and Telugu to cover language diversity. Usability tasks involved installing the app, searching &amp;amp; reading an article of their choice, and any additional feedback to improve the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of session learnings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users appreciated the ease of discovering articles in multiple languages and the simplicity of changing the app language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can change before searching only. I will use this feature because I can use it  whenever I want to read in Marathi. - User 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users liked quick links to help them access different sections of an article, view images, and quickly access important facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is part of the same article. This is like a shortcut, so from here I can read any topic related to the article. - User 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users were confused when certain articles were unavailable when they changed the app language to their regional language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I search for ‘Dosa recipe in hindi’ using voice search I get the results, here maybe the information is available in English only and not Hindi. - User 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users could not understand the icon used for quick facts and considered it a map icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I expected to see a map here, as the icon used for it was of a location. - User 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most users did not read the onboarding descriptions as they mostly ignore that part in other apps too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app was first released in India in September 2020 and was later released globally in December 2020. It has been downloaded over 2.5M times since its first release. In the next update, we are looking forward to improving article discovery and the overall reading experience. Improvements would include contextual onboarding to quickly start the app, a trending article list to find content beyond search functionality, and other minor changes to improve issues observed during usability sessions. Stay tuned for all the amazing work the Inuka team does to support new internet users in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people don’t realize that along with Wikipedia, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimediafoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; hosts a number of other projects, ranging from reference projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page&quot;&gt;Wiktionary&lt;/a&gt; to software projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki&quot;&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt;. These projects belong to everyone and like Wikipedia, are free to use to further our goal of providing the essential infrastructure for free knowledge &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt; is one of these projects and is the world’s largest free-to-use library of illustrations, photos, drawings, videos, and music. Wikimedia Commons hosts more than 71 million freely usable media files&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-1&quot; id=&quot;ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to which anyone can contribute. It also hosts and organizes a majority of the media you encounter on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, one of the tasks of the structured data team, a cross-functional product team at the Wikimedia Foundation, was to focus on how to improve the search experience on Wikimedia Commons to better surface all of the media files contributed by people from around the world. One of the key tenets of this work was making the experience less intimidating, in particular to those not familiar with Wikimedia Commons. Being able to support a wide range of use-cases, from power users like museums digitizing their photography collection to a high school student using Wikimedia Commons for the first time to find free usable media to complete a science project, was critical to building a successful search experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One obvious area the team focused on was ways to improve search accuracy since it doesn’t matter what you do with the presentation if the actual results aren’t mapping to the expectations of the searcher. However, this article, being written by the designer on the team, will be focused on the work that was done to ensure a much better experience that was created to complement these improved search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the average person hears that I’m the designer on the Growth team for Wikipedia, there’s a common misconception that it’s about growing the number of readers, the more commonly thought of “Wikipedia user”. However, our team was formed almost three years ago with a different challenge and audience as our focus. This article aims to tell the six-part story of how and why we started this team, and all the failures, learnings, and successes we’ve had since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;baseline-research&quot;&gt;Baseline research&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/Special_Search_on_Commons.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Special Search on Commons&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Largely untouched in its 17-year history, a screenshot of search on Wikimedia Commons before we started this project. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Special_Search_on_Commons.jpg&quot;&gt;Special Search on Commons&lt;/a&gt; | Public Domain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kicked this project off with a round of research to get a more honest understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of search on Wikimedia Commons. With only a few quotes from the participants of this research, you can see what we were up against:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is so much text and details, it was hard to find what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was frustrating to find all of the advanced search options, I figured it out after a while but didn’t expect to find them where I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t feel like a very nice display of results…difficult to see the details and evaluate the results with such small images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It feels complicated and the images are hard to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s extra work to  navigate back and forth between the file page and search to get everything I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t trust it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can read, there was room for improvement. We needed to make the search experience more familiar and easy to use. Image search on the web is not a novel problem but the uniqueness of search on Wikimedia Commons was detrimental to casual users and those not intimately familiar with the project. With over 3 million daily page views&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-2&quot; id=&quot;ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on Wikimedia Commons, it’s more than obvious we needed to build a tool that made sense to everyone and aligned closer to their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also knew that our most passionate contributors to the Wikimedia Commons project needed certain features and tools to help with their work. Would it be possible to make an experience that both catered to those unfamiliar with Wikimedia Commons and those that use it every day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-more-functional-and-familiar-interface&quot;&gt;Creating a more functional and familiar interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/Search_on_Wikimedia_Commons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the search experience on Wikimedia Commons&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Upon clicking of a result, you can see more information in a “quick view panel” | &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Search_on_Wikimedia_Commons.jpg&quot;&gt;Search on Wikimedia Commons with Quick View&lt;/a&gt; | By Matthew Williams | &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working through a myriad of wireframes, ideas, and approaches with the team, we began to arrive at some key areas we were going to focus on. One of the more visually obvious changes we started with was moving towards a grid layout that more effectively uses the space and highlights the media shown. Even with images around twice as large, we are able to show around three times as many results before needing to scroll. With as many results as we have, this helped users more quickly parse what Wikimedia Commons has to offer. Other interface improvements included surfacing all the different media types available upfront, making filters easier to find and use, and adding more information to a “quick view panel” upon clicking to eliminate the need to leave the page as often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/Media_Search_and_Other_File_Types.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshots of Media Search while searching for other file types&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also separated the different types of media files into tabs. It became clear throughout the conversations with research participants that combining all file types into one result set was overwhelming, especially when the majority of visitors just wanted to search for images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/Media_Search_on_Mobile_Web.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshots of the search experience of Commons on Mobile Web&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 30% of all Wikimedia Commons usage&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-3&quot; id=&quot;ref-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on mobile web, we also wanted to make sure that all of these improvements were considered and easy to use on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community-input&quot;&gt;Community Input&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear from research and usability studies that we were making progress with those less familiar with Wikimedia Commons, but what about those who use it the most frequently, like the countless contributors and volunteers, galleries, libraries, and museums?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new search experience was designed and built with these communities’ involvement from the ground up, with Wikimedia Commons contributors involved from conception and design to prototyping to the final push for feature completion prior to launch. The team planned a robust feedback cycle for sharing, bringing in information, iterating, and communicating with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community involvement began in May 2020 with sharing the ideas and designs, and by June the community was using a prototype. Over the next nine months, the development team would go through six distinct feedback cycles, with a total of 24 community members participating and leaving detailed ideas, comments, concerns, and questions to improve the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial feedback was positive and helped us refine many aspects of the new experience. For example, one of the many pieces of useful feedback was a request for a filter that was able to search specifically for images that had received an assessment. Assessments are a system that the community has created to recognize important contributions across Wikimedia Commons, with groupings such as featured pictures, valued images, quality images, and picture of the day. This filter in particular was an excellent suggestion that we were able to implement that really sets Wikimedia Commons apart from other image searching tools with its human-powered curation at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making significant progress, we completed a wide array of usability tests to understand if the answers and changes we had applied from the initial baseline research were actually improving the experience. Here are some of the quotes from those interviews:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much clearer and simpler to use. I prefer this version because the images are bigger. There were so many details in the old search that it was hard to see what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is comparatively much simpler and clearer to understand, with less space wasted in this format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It feels easier because it requires less clicking and the options are more visible. It also had more images to see at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is more intuitive, user friendly and easier to navigate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This feels much easier to operate and it is comfortable to use. It was much simpler in style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also conducted a survey in late December 2020/early January 2021, asking users directly if they had a preference for the new search experience or legacy search. We received 40 responses, again showing a preference for the new search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the evidence from that research and analysis, as well as the qualitative and quantitative feedback from the community, we decided to make this new search experience the default search on Wikimedia Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this update, we hope to have made finding and discovering this amazing treasure trove of freely usable media on the internet just a bit easier while honoring all of the hard work and contributions people around the world have made to Wikimedia Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
