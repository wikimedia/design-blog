&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-wikifunctions&quot;&gt;What is Wikifunctions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikifunctions will be a collaboratively edited multilingual library of functions. It will be the first platform The Wikimedia Foundation launches since &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikidata&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, and part of a bigger vision towards an Abstract Wikipedia, which you can read about at &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Abstract Wikipedia on meta-wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-function-and-its-parts&quot;&gt;A function and its parts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a programmer you might not be familiar with what a function needs to be usable, or to use technical-speak “to run”. A function takes an input (e.g. the population of a city) and provides an output (e.g. the acres of watershed needed to supply residents with water). It can do this calculation over and over again for different cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function has three parts. The function definition (part 1), the implementation (part 2), and a test (part 3) to validate. These three components – the definition, implementation, and tests – are what a function needs to perform and be usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A definition defines the functions behavior. What type of inputs does it accept? How many? What will it output? An implementation is the set of instructions that transforms an input into an output. A test is what validates the implementation and ensures it performs correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-functions-do&quot;&gt;What can functions do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, you might use a function to wake up in the morning. Let’s say you want to sleep 8 hours tonight, you could ask a function, &lt;em&gt;“If I go to sleep at 10 P.M. what time should I wake up to get 8 hours of sleep?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples-of-general-questions-that-could-be-answered-by-functions&quot;&gt;Examples of general questions that could be answered by functions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the distance from my house in northern Sao Paulo, Brazil to the nearest beach?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I took out a $240,000 loan and my loan term is 30-year fixed with a 4% interest rate, what is my monthly mortgage?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the omicron variant has a transmission rate of 25% among vaccinated people, how quickly could it spread in a city with 2,059 people per square kilometer, 95% of whom are vaccinated?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When in the next ten years will my birthday fall on a Saturday if I was born March 28, 1954?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples-of-wikimedia-related-questions-that-could-be-answered-by-functions&quot;&gt;Examples of Wikimedia-related questions that could be answered by functions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given the dates of birth and death of a person, how old did the person get?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given a population and an area, what is the population density?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given an image on Commons, crop it and run it through a filter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given two images on Commons, which one is more red?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Based on Wikidata, how are Queen Elizabeth II and Barack Obama related to each other?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions are ubiquitous in modern life, from the apps we use daily (e.g. maps and search) to the analyses made by scientists, doctors, journalists, and financial advisors, functions enable our activities by efficiently and precisely making meaning through calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions will provide the code that translates language-independent articles from Abstract Wikipedia into natural language Wikipedia articles. This will theoretically allow more people to share more knowledge in more languages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This blog post is about how to create, view, and edit functions in Wikifunctions, and the design process behind making this happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;our-audience&quot;&gt;Our audience&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to other Wikimedia projects, our hope and aim is for Wikifunctions to be inviting, accessible to, and available to all people across the world. This is why we are designing a &lt;strong&gt;multilingual platform that is mobile friendly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several roles for people within the Wikifunctions ecosystem. There are “answer seekers”, or people who simply want to learn about functions and use them. A level deeper are those who edit or materially contribute to Wikifunctions in some capacity. They could be function patrollers, programmers who write implementations, translators, admins who approve of proposed implementations and tests, or test writers who QA implementations. These folks will maintain functions and documentation. Among these editors there will be technical and nontechnical folks. Leading up to launch and post-launch, &lt;strong&gt;our team aims to increase the agency of the nontechnical folks and “junior” techies&lt;/strong&gt; by creating pathways for them to contribute meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of creating these pathways is simplifying a complicated process. Functions are not simple. They are complex in that they require computational thinking and well-written documentation. When designing the creation experience, our objective was to design an editor interface that looks and feels friendly to nontechnical people and radically simplifies a complex process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;our-approach&quot;&gt;Our approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explored different mental models for Wikifunctions such as collaborative coding, a structured Q&amp;amp;A forum, a homework helper, infrastructure for Abstract Wikipedia, and a ‘generic library of functions’. &lt;strong&gt;We settled on the structured Q&amp;amp;A model, where we conceive of functions as tools which can answer structured questions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikifunctions/our-approach.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our approach&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WMF’s mission is to unlock knowledge and help all people share in it, freely. The Abstract Wikipedia team believes that functions can play a key role in unlocking knowledge, and sees Wikifunctions as a crucial player in moving all of us towards this mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a source of power to know how to write and use functions. It gives the person the power of knowledge creation. Our objective when designing the function creation experience was to make it as friendly, intuitive, and simple as possible so that more people can have access to this power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-design-principles&quot;&gt;Our design principles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conceptual simplicity: Given the complex nature of this project, our team aims to radically simplify the concepts involved so that we might be inclusive of all people, especially those who are less familiar with functions, code, natural language processing, or lexicographic knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intuitive interface: We want to build a system with a shallow onramp, one that anyone can figure out and engage with in meaningful ways. We wish for there to be little gap between a newcomer’s existing knowledge (i.e. current knowledge) and the knowledge they need to operate the product (i.e. target knowledge). Our interface will provide community members with an uninterrupted experience, where they are well-supported to complete tasks with relative ease and confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multilingual: In a world where all people can share in the sum of all knowledge, it is critical that Wikimedia products are designed as multilingual interfaces and experiences. From the beginning, the Abstract Wikipedia team will prioritize designing for and testing in the native languages of our community-members. Our objective is to move at the speed of trust with all populations, but especially with small Wikis and underrepresented groups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balance: We wish to acknowledge that many of our community members will be veterans of Wikipedia, Wikidata, or any of the movement’s other projects. Many of them will be highly-skilled at navigating technical interfaces and desire customizability similar to Wikipedia or other open source projects. The challenge before us is prioritizing the needs of non-programmers and those with little-to-no coding experience while keeping in mind the expectations of veterans. This will require flexibility and openness in our designs, and filtering design decisions through multiple lenses in order to ensure that we are not locked into any one particular user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-have-implemented-these-principles-by-doing-the-following&quot;&gt;We have implemented these principles by doing the following:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intentionally minimizing the use of technical jargon and providing a glossary of terms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing tooltips and informative microcopy on every interface&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focused attention on information hierarchy so as not to overwhelm users with information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User testing with nontechnical people and iterating to meet their needs and expectations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User testing with technical people to ensure we are not causing irritation or creating unnecessary roadblocks to their progress
-Multilingual design and usability testing (testing is in the planning process)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-use-wikifunctions&quot;&gt;How to use Wikifunctions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-function&quot;&gt;Creating a function&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we wanted to create a function that determined if two words rhymed. The “two words” are two inputs of type &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;, and the output is a single “yes or no”, which is a type &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boolean&lt;/a&gt;. To create a function that could do this, we would need to tell the system, “Hey this function &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;accepts two inputs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, both have to be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;strings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and the function’s output will be a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boolean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This process is known as “defining” the function, and it is the first step in creating a function.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team believes that the UI and UX for defining a function must be as inclusive as possible because, technically, anyone can do it. It requires no coding or composition writing. Defining a function can be thought of as a request: &lt;em&gt;“Hey I want a function that does X”&lt;/em&gt; translates to &lt;em&gt;“the function accepts this input, returns this output”&lt;/em&gt;. We also provide a way to add documentation so that the user can further explain what they’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-challenge-1-the-function-editor&quot;&gt;Design challenge 1: The function editor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We initially planned to design a “function editor” that provided an end-to-end experience, meaning users could define, implement, and test in one environment. Since we were designing for &lt;strong&gt;technical and nontechnical people&lt;/strong&gt;, we hypothesized that unifying the experience would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simplify the concept of what a function needs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide a contextual experience which would be helpful for nontechnical users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep related tasks together&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow more senior editors to move in and out of the process as they pleased&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not slow down the technical audience from using the editor as they wanted, while providing guardrails for nontechnical users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early drafts and variations of an end-to-end function editor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikifunctions/early-draft01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Early draft 1&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikifunctions/early-draft03.png&quot; alt=&quot;Early draft 3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UX was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/tags/miro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/figma&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wd-query-builder.toolforge.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Wikidata query builder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/tags/typeform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Typeform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pivoting –&lt;/strong&gt; we tested these mockups with technical non-Wikimedians and Wikimedians, and the results were overwhelmingly positive. However, as our developers were building this design, &lt;strong&gt;we realized that the underlying design of the system was incompatible with this approach.&lt;/strong&gt; Function definitions, implementations, and tests are all separate objects in Wikifunctions, and each object can refer to other objects within it, such as data types (e.g. strings, Booleans, or other functions). &lt;strong&gt;Due to the complexity allowed for each object, we decided it’s best to keep each creation experience separate.&lt;/strong&gt; Objects also have their own pages, so any object you create automatically publishes as a Page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the function editor is a place only for defining the function, in other words part one of creating a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-challenge-2-a-function-page&quot;&gt;Design challenge 2: A function page&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you publish a function that you’ve defined, it is saved and published as a function page. &lt;strong&gt;This is the page where all parts of a function live.&lt;/strong&gt; We framed this page as an entry point for the community to learn about, use, and/or edit a function. The goal of this page is to help people progressively edit a function or simply engage with one. The challenge of this page, and a Wikifunctions motif, is that the page must appeal to both non-technical and technical people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-short-term-goals-were-to&quot;&gt;Our short term goals were to&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help all users &lt;strong&gt;UNDERSTAND&lt;/strong&gt; the function so that they can edit or use it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENCOURAGE&lt;/strong&gt; users with coding backgrounds to make technical contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENCOURAGE&lt;/strong&gt; users who are not coders to make non-technical contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Usability test a Figma prototype of the product solution with people who have a strong coding background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-hopes-and-dreams-were-to&quot;&gt;Our hopes and dreams were to&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage everyone that views a function to try using it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support coders who want to make technical contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encourage users who don’t code to make non-technical contributions because functions need names, aliases, translations of the name/input labels, and documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-aimed-to-avoid&quot;&gt;We aimed to avoid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confusing, discouraging, overwhelming, or intimidating non-coders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unintentionally signaling to non-coders that this isn’t a space for them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Irritating coders by slowing them down or hiding important actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function page as it currently exists today. A user lands on a function page’s ‘About’ tab and can toggle between ‘About’ and ‘Details’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikifunctions/function-page.png&quot; alt=&quot;function page&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A user can learn more about the technical details of the function on the ‘Details’ tab, such as how many available implementations and verified testers it has, and what the definition is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;prologue&quot;&gt;Prologue&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the discussion page about Nellie Bly’s article, communication isn’t the easiest in normal circumstances. You have to hunt for, and then decipher, little clues scattered around the page to initiate a conversation, and then navigate a confusing interface with seemingly-arcane glyphs to orient yourself in the conversation, all while trying to write what you actually came to discuss. A few months back, I wanted to add a photo of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nellie_Bly_-_The_Girl_Puzzle.jpg?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Girl Puzzle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a monument which is located on Roosevelt Island, New York that memorializes Nellie Bly. I think that this image will show how revered she still is for her journalistic work and, since there are very few images of her, it is a nice representation of her likeness. I walk to the monument on the north edge of this island situated within the center of Manhattan, take a photo and prepare to post it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt; so that it can be linked and posted on the Wikipedia article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I got stuck. Am I allowed to post this? Are there copyright issues? I visited the discussion page on the English Wikipedia and tried to start a new topic. It’s not easy, but ultimately I realized that I needed to click the “add new section” tab in the interface and ask about inserting the image into the article. After some conversation I wrote &lt;em&gt;“I can take a photo, but would that make it alright to post it or do I need to get approval from the artist?”&lt;/em&gt; I didn’t know the rules around image rights. I magically got responses from other contributors, but I didn’t even notice that they wrote back to me until a month later when I checked the page. Eventually, I’m guided to a number of different policy pages, and from these I figured out that the best way to get the image up is to get an appropriately licensed photo from the monument’s owners, and then go back to the article to post the image and its associated information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its own, figuring out the best way to get and include an image on the article was painful, but figuring that out while trying to navigate the obscure conventions for using the discussion interface, now that was excruciating. On-wiki communication has gotten a lot better for me personally over time because I have at my disposal colleagues and long-term contributors who I actually know and can help me to learn. That’s great, but for others it has not gone so well; potential contributors just give up. They just stop trying. By their thousands. The Editing Team set out to make moments like this less painful, so that as a contributor, you can just focus on the point that you are trying to get across and improve the encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;making-easier-to-use-tools&quot;&gt;Making easier-to-use tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/03/10/people-are-talking.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first installment&lt;/a&gt; in this series, I shared how we in the Editing Team conducted research and collaborated with community members to identify a design strategy for the project. The heart of our strategy involves us diving deeply into the asynchronous collaboration experience. To do this, our approach is to first make it easier for contributors to use the tools and then, when we have confirmed that the tools are useful, follow that up by making it easier for folks to discover them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We undertook a virtual “listening tour”, where we heard from contributors with a variety of experience levels on Talk Pages share what their interactions there were like. From this, we identified four initial opportunities to improve the Talk Page experience that I will walk you through today. Our hypothesis was that addressing these problems would mean that contributors have a more positive and productive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-1-theres-no-clear-way-to-engage&quot;&gt;Problem 1: There’s no clear way to engage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at this discussion page here, you can see that it’s very challenging to identify what to even click to reply to these discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/edit-link.png&quot; alt=&quot;The way to reply to comments currently is to click an “edit” link.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The way to reply to comments currently is to click an “edit” link.
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to click the “edit” button to reply. Not obvious. What you’d expect here is a clear call to action, something that says “reply” on it that you can press and initiate the workflow for writing back to someone in a conversation. So that’s what we did. We made a minimal, non-invasive change, which was to add inline links with a more obvious word: “Reply”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/reply-link.png&quot; alt=&quot;Using words that readers expect to see in discussion spaces such as “reply”  as calls to action can be helpful.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Using words that readers expect to see in discussion spaces such as “reply”  as calls to action can be helpful.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this one change seems simple, it was hugely technically challenging to implement within the constraints that the Wikipedia software gives us. Previous approaches had been hamstrung, either by making trivial systems that don’t work for all the hundreds of language communities that are already part of the Wikimedia movement, or by trying to replace discussion pages and all the functionalities that our communities have built into them over the decades that Wikimedia has been going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Principal Engineer Ed Sanders puts it, “Existing wikitext talk pages are completely unstructured. That means that all the information is thrown together in what we’ve been calling a wikitext soup. And while humans may be able to parse it out by looking at the structure of the conversation, it’s not easy for the software to do this.” For us to extract useful information from the page we needed to build a new tool which we called the Comment Parser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Comment Parser works by breaking up that flat page into structured data. There are lots of edge cases to consider here: hundreds of timestamp formats, multi-line comments with mixed indentation, strange username links. By rolling this out slowly to different communities we’ve been able to identify more edge cases and improve the accuracy of the parser. It helps us to know where comments start and end so we can add the individual reply links to conversations. It also allows us to insert your reply in the correct place with the correct amount of indentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who had used the Structured Discussions system, a key difference is this implementation approach is that, according to Ed, “all the information is &lt;strong&gt;extracted from the page, and not the tool,&lt;/strong&gt; so we can apply this insight to edits made with the full page editor.” The Editing Team’s Product Manager noted that “a key requirement when we spoke to the community was compatibility with existing workflows, so being agnostic about which editor was used means we can do things like show notifications regardless of what editing interface people are using to trigger them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-2-the-interface-for-writing-is-confusing&quot;&gt;Problem 2: The interface for writing is confusing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the reply button, you now have a nice entry point into the workflow. That said, actually writing a reply was still confusing for a handful of reasons, including the fact that there’s manual threading, the ability to edit other people’s comments by accident, edit-centric language, and you needed to know the wikitext conventions for signing and dating your posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/sign-name.png&quot; alt=&quot;To sign your name and add a date you need to write four tildas “~~~~”&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;To sign your name and add a date you need to write four tildas “~~~~”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same problems also applied to starting new topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/new-topics.png&quot; alt=&quot;Having to add basic contact information via wikitext isn’t intuitive to most contributors.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Having to add basic contact information via wikitext isn’t intuitive to most contributors.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We addressed this by making it possible to reply and sign your name automatically. This alone would have made a huge difference, because it’s frankly a real pain to have to write “ ~~~~ “ after every single post. We built upon this moment to reduce the complexity of mentioning another Wikipedian, formatting your response, and identifying your comment in the discussion. Again, we made this change inline and more contextual, so that it just felt like an organic conversation experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For adding new topics we made a similar, more obvious workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/new-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;Point, click, type and add:the new design for adding new topics. &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Point, click, type and add:the new design for adding new topics.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-3-missing-notifications&quot;&gt;Problem 3: Missing Notifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a contributor, you were now in the situation where you could start and reply to topics, but in terms of getting notified if someone replied to you, well you got nothing, unless that person knew to use one of the many user-generated templates to @-mention you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact it was even worse than nothing – you would sometimes get a small amount of notifications based on a  set of rules so confusing that you’d have no idea if the other person is getting notified. So, we fixed this with a series of iterations on notifications. We created topic subscriptions, so you can choose if and how you want to be informed about activity within the conversation that you are in. If you’ve used the Structured Discussions tool, you’ll be familiar with these, but you will now get notifications for normal talk page edits, even if the other contributor isn’t using our tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we validated the effectiveness of that feature, we heard from contributors that there are just some conversations that they want to be automatically added to, so that’s what we’ve been working on recently. We have the technology in place and are still checking with test users to ensure that the tools aren’t over-communicating to contributors in such a way that it feels noisy and unwelcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/talk-is-cheap/subscribe-link.png&quot; alt=&quot;Subscribing you to a particular topic will give you timely updates about discussions that you deem important.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-4-talk-pages-look-like-articles&quot;&gt;Problem 4: Talk pages look like articles.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In English there’s a metaphorical idiom of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the elephant in the room&lt;/a&gt;,” which means that there’s something very important that needs to be discussed but it’s probably going to be a little awkward to talk about it. For talk pages, that elephant is the fact that article pages look very similar to talk pages, and it confuses people who are new to the concept of a talk page. Headings are the same, the table of contents is the same, and there’s no other indication that this is a place where people can have conversations. This is where we are now. We are beginning to explore ways to make it more obvious what this page is all about by emphasizing elements on the page so that you can easily see what conversations are active, who is talking in them, and how you can get involved in them. This will be addressed in a future release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve heard a lot of positive feedback about these improvements. Here are some nice quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…I like the fact that it’s very stripped down and doesn’t feel data intense… The colors are pleasing to the eye. Simple to navigate interface. Overall, it works the way I’d expect it to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Usability Test Participant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think this is the best new feature since years and finally an approach to simplify discussion pages without breaking the workflow of experienced users. So thank you very much for your effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– &lt;strong&gt;User:Hgzh,&lt;/strong&gt; German Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feedback is crucial to the success of these tools. Peter explained that “As a fundamentally social and community-driven project, conversation is a core part of Wikipedia. It is a core practice that shapes Wikipedia’s policies, culture and ultimately, the knowledge that is and is NOT represented within it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want testers and skeptics to try these tools out so that I can refine and if necessary rethink the design proposal. What’s particularly great about having a beta release channel is that it offers an opportunity to get things wrong and then quickly throw up a new proposal for review. Try out the tools yourself by going into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Beta_Features?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; or global preferences and turning on Discussions Tools. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk_pages_project?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Let us know what you think&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a discussion, afterall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;epilogue&quot;&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the help of the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, I was successfully able to add the image of The Girl Puzzle to &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nellie_Bly_-_The_Girl_Puzzle.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Bly?useskin=vector-2022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diverse teams generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;perform better than others&lt;/a&gt;, but what do we mean by diversity and how do we know what diversity exists within our own teams?  Most people consider diversity to be things like gender, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic identity, religion, languages spoken, age, educational background, etc. and ultimately everyone has multiple facets to their identity that make them who they are, but some of these facets are not always visible in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month my colleague and I organised and facilitated our annual three-day virtual offsite, for our global team of 25 designers and researchers. Across the team we span multiple timezones and continents and are a very global team geographically, but we are also an entirely English-language speaking team, grounded in many of the cultural norms of American society, where the Wikimedia Foundations headquarters are based. So we decided to focus the offsite on an overarching theme of ‘communication,’ with a particular focus on understanding a little more about each person’s cultural background and the role communication played in this for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-idea&quot;&gt;The idea&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We surveyed the team to find out what languages everyone spoke, and what each person’s native language was. We discovered that almost half the team had NOT learnt English as their first language. It occurred to me then that if we could actually hear every person in the team, speak about themselves in their native language, we may experience something quite different about each other. What if we hired translators to translate team members speaking in their first language?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to be sure that people were encouraged to open up as much or as little as they felt comfortable doing in this context. We were aware that for some people speaking about themselves in a large group can feel quite intimidating, and different people have different levels of personal information they want to share in a work environment. So I thought that perhaps adding a level of abstraction to the conversation might ease this tension. We decided to ask folks to describe themselves through a set of ‘artifacts’ or ‘objects’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the session we asked each person to spend some time identifying and thinking about some objects in their lives that had significance for them. What did they mean to them personally, and what did they say about who they were? They prepared for the activity by following these guidelines;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify a set of three ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artifact&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;’ (or objects) that show…&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Something that represents different aspects of your &lt;strong&gt;personality&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Something that represents the &lt;strong&gt;culture(s)&lt;/strong&gt; you most closely associate with.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Something that represents the &lt;strong&gt;method of communication&lt;/strong&gt; that makes you feel most alive.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take photos or download images of your artifacts and add them to a shared slide deck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepare to talk for 2 minutes about your artifacts and why you chose them, in your native language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;activity&quot;&gt;Activity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hired seven translators to join the online event and translate the talks, sentence-by-sentence, from Hindi, Cantonese, German, French, Italian, Russian and Spanish back into English for the team. As the activity flowed I could see the faces of the team lit up with intrigue and curiosity as they discovered a whole new side to their teammates. As one person later said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Hearing my colleagues speak in their native language was like meeting new people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were highly creative in how they interpreted the activity and chose fascinating objects to describe themselves. For example, one person showed a picture of a digital watch to describe their personality whilst another showed a tent hung between two trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/surfacing-embracing-diversity/watch-tent.png&quot; alt=&quot;Digital watch to describe their personality whilst another showed a tent hung between two trees.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people chose very similar objects to describe their culture, often when they in fact came from quite different backgrounds. For example, a couple of people chose stones and objects from nature, whilst two showed pictures of their bikes, and two others shared bottles of olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/surfacing-embracing-diversity/nature-objects.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stones and objects from nature, whilst two showed pictures of their bikes, and two others shared bottles of olive oil.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people chose music as the method of communication that makes them feel most alive.  Perhaps we should have a team playlist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;learnings&quot;&gt;Learnings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of translating the talks wasn’t easy, given the fact that many of the people in the team actually spoke better English than some of the professional translators we had hired. This meant that when a few of the translations appeared not to be entirely accurate, some of the people doing their talks, felt the need to briefly re-explain what had been said in English.  As one of the participants said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Listening to translators on the first day, especially when it was evident there was missed or incorrect interpretation. It really highlighted the invisible communication issues we face as designers and researchers working on a multilingual product with people from around the world, and the importance of reviewing text, written, speech, and visual communications as there is so much room for (mis)interpretation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this whole process was very interesting to observe and felt like as much part of the experience as the talking was. As the challenges of speaking and translating different languages became evident throughout the exercise, one participant observed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Hearing fellow team members presenting in their native languages was a lovely moment that made me appreciate what a global team we have and also full of admiration of how so many people communicate so eloquently in English when it’s their second language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was something about this experience that allowed us all to connect on a different level. One person said to me that no-one had ever asked them to speak their native language at work before. By seeing the different facets of each other and starting to form new types of connections, we began to see how our different views and perspectives actually bring us together and make us stronger as a team. And in turn, this will lay the foundations for being able to work on more complex problems together and ultimately build even better products. As one of my colleagues so beautifully put it;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“All the moments of hearing my multi-cultural team speaking in different languages was such a beautiful sound and an aural reminder of our diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve shared this story today in the hopes that it may inspire others to run a similar activity in their own teams. If you do, please share your experience, we would love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">An activity to speak your native language.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/assets/uploads/surfacing-embracing-diversity/header.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/assets/uploads/surfacing-embracing-diversity/header.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Understanding the Wiki Communications and Mentorship Ecosystems</title><link href="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/20/understanding-the-wiki-communications-and-mentorship-ecosystems.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Understanding the Wiki Communications and Mentorship Ecosystems" /><published>2021-12-20T07:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-20T07:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/20/understanding-the-wiki-communications-and-mentorship-ecosystems</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/20/understanding-the-wiki-communications-and-mentorship-ecosystems.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dchen@wikimedia.org&quot;&gt;Daisy Chen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Wikimedia Foundation’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Growth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Growth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Editing_team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Editing&lt;/a&gt; teams were respectively making plans and progress on Newcomer features and Talk Pages in recent quarters, the teams were curious about where and how wiki users are communicating with one another, and how mentorship manifests within the communication ecosystem. As a first step in this process, &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/strategy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Product Design Strategy&lt;/a&gt; completed an initial round of research with a participant cohort of primarily affiliate group members, Foundation staff, and other long-time volunteers to illuminate the communications/mentorship ecosystem and identify areas of potential future study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-we-wanted-to-learn&quot;&gt;What we wanted to learn&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Growth and Editing teams wanted to keep the research and discovery process open-ended, they both had some goals in mind for their respective teams’ work. The Growth team hoped the research outcomes would inform the mentorship and collaboration opportunities being tested in the Newcomer program initiatives. The Editing team wanted to understand use cases, benefits and impacts of various communication channels being utilized and how that might feed their work on Talk Pages and New Discussion Tool. Both teams felt this research would impact ongoing work and future plans around communication features/support and mentorship/collaboration opportunities, and we jointly created a couple grounding sets of research questions to that end:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communications&quot;&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the various communication tools used by different communities to have these discussions?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What types of work are done on these channels?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do community members communicate besides on wiki (ie., besides Talk pages, Village Pump, etc) across different language wikis?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the motivations for using on and/vs off wiki channels? What are the benefits and tradeoffs of each?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are these tools used instead/as well, and what are their efficacies as effective/positive communication tools?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mentorship&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is mentorship defined? What does it look like on the ground?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What factors influence mentorship motivation? How can users be encouraged to mentor others, and see their impacts?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How has/does communicating with other contributors affect newcomers’ understanding of Wikipedia as a community of people working together and their connection to it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the efficacy of the off wiki channels specifically in attracting and fostering new contributors?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can productivity tools that promote collaborative editing/communication/tracking, potentially integrated on wiki, also affect mentorship effectiveness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;our-research-participants-and-process&quot;&gt;Our research participants and process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To contain the scope of this initial round of research (with a second round envisioned to expand our research into other segments), we decided to keep our first participant cohort to those who have had more experience working in the various wiki communities. These folks worked in a wide range of wiki-related roles both in various organizational and volunteer capacities; the goal was to hear about their communications and mentorship experiences at length. Interviews were conducted in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few target languages/regions came into focus after reviewing geographic areas of interest the Growth and Editing teams pinpointed and where ongoing recruitment of potential participants seemed to be proving most fruitful. Ultimately, the participants were determined after evaluating languages, regions and genders represented, and diversity of roles within the wiki movement, among other factors. The languages/regions in particular were determined when we were able to establish a ‘critical mass’ of sorts, where we spoke with enough participants in each to start observing patterns in their responses and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We concluded the project with 18 participant interviews across 4 primary geographic regions. Each of the interviews were semi-structured, with a prepared discussion guide to provide a basic framework for the exploration while allowing for the participants to freely express both directly and tangentially relevant experiences and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-did-we-discover-in-these-conversations&quot;&gt;What did we discover in these conversations?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communications-1&quot;&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devices and access.&lt;/strong&gt; Even given the characteristics of this cohort (juggling a wide range of audiences and channels both on and off wiki, high volume of communication, high relative access to digital resources), none of the participants indicated that they used their mobile as a primary device for their communications. Many indicated that laptop/desktop access made many tasks easier to accomplish as some on wiki tasks are not yet mobile-friendly or lack appropriate functionality (in addition to inherent screen and device limitations). Laptop/desktop use was also convenient as many classically mobile tasks (texting, sending images, calling) are increasingly available from a desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/devices-used.png&quot; alt=&quot;Devices used to communicate for wiki work.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this is the direct finding from this cohort, many from the cohort broached the issue that many existing and potential users, especially from the Southeast Asia and South Asia (India) regions, are facing device/digital resource limitations. They may face inconsistent internet infrastructure/access, limited/expensive data, and limited access to devices (no/shared access to a singular mobile device, paid entry to internet cafes with device access). To address this, optimizing our mobile experience in terms of accessibility/reliability and additional features while limiting bandwidth used where possible is key to reaching this audience further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On or off wiki communication?&lt;/strong&gt; This cohort bucked expectations again here; even though their wiki communication is heavily due to a wiki-related role/obligation and their individual capacities as volunteers, they tended to do most of the communication off the wikis. Those who utilized on-wiki communications more often indicated they did so primarily for posting official updates and documenting conversations and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants often strategically move conversations between on and off wiki channels, most specifically moving discussions to off wiki channels and then returning on wiki to document the outcomes and decisions from those discussions. The reasons given for moving discussions off wiki included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;expediency (having the discussions was logistically quicker to do on off wiki channels)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wider reach/more inclusive (more people quantitatively in general and more were engaged in the conversation than on on wiki alternative arenas)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more availability for private or otherwise sensitive conversation as needed (everything on wiki is visible for anyone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, many participants empathetically said that being on wiki is a “disadvantage” and an “inequality”, especially for newer users. The learning curve overall, the invisibility of accessing help and finding communication channels, understanding the norms of communication in each wiki community – all contribute to why the cohort as a rule tends to try and meet newer users where they are, which is most often an off wiki channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/where-participants-communicate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Where do our participants communicate.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;“The more time you put in off wiki, the less time you need to defend it on meta&quot;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;On and off wiki channels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Below you’ll find examples of channels being used both on and off wiki, an approximated scorecard of the pros and cons of the two main options, and basic flow charts of the most common use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt; off wiki channels score higher on all listed criteria for our participants and provide the most helpful outcomes when it comes to the tasks and connections they need to make in their wiki work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off wiki channels as a whole offer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quicker responses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;more casual feel that can lead to more sincere communication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;option for private conversations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;better accessibility and mobile/UI-friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where does off wiki communication fall short as a category? The regard for on wiki legitimacy remains; it is a must for announcements, recording of important decisions and outcomes, and everything posted is public, documentable, and referenceable. The transparency and accountability on off wiki options are not as clear cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/on-off-wiki-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;On and off wiki chart.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do participants think could improve communication?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The participant suggestions below are charted on a continuum of simple to execute (left/green) to the more complex (right/red). They are also sorted into suggestions that could impact communications more directly (top half) and changes that have more of an indirect impact (bottom half).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mentorship-1&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentorship as described by many participants is transactional and editing-centric. A few members of this cohort, while tackling task-based, editing-focused questions, have also emphasized and lived the importance of additional facets of a mentorship relationship. Moving forward, we should support a tailored approach to mentorship, one that spans the transactional/functional (knowing what/how to do) to the institutional/inspirational (understanding of the movement, engagement borne of interest, belonging and recognition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We need longevity and sustainability from good mentorship. Do we want 1 person who edits 100 times or get 10 people to do 10 edits each?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this framework, we’ll also need to address our users’ varying needs. While facilitating “human-powered” means of mentorship interactions, we should also take care to supplement learning with technical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/examples-of-mentorship.png&quot; alt=&quot;Examples of mentorship and their impacts and frequencies, charted.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Examples of mentorship and their impacts and frequencies, charted&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answering questions about editing tasks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This could be on a one-off or an ongoing basis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specific, targeted Commons photo advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A participant brought up this example; this individual received specific, actionable feedback on why photos were not being approved and what it would take for a photo to be approved and even featured&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating and disseminating tutorial type materials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holding editing-focused workshops and events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaching about the movement and opportunities;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. Making mentees aware of the larger movement, organizational structures, and providing advice on mentees’ draft proposals for their own projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Involving people in a hobby-based campaign;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. The Wiki Loves Butterfly initiative involved finding butterfly enthusiasts on social media, motivating them to join wiki, having 1:1 chats with them and meeting in person, showing them commons/uploading/categories and other editing-related tasks, doing/coordinating fieldwork and taking butterfly lifecycle photos, holding photo workshops etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constant communication and community;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. Wiki World Heritage User Group holds workshops and is in constant communication/collaboration. Its engagement plan also includes a skills assessment in which members and newcomers are asked about knowledge on various topics/tools, and where they’d like to learn more. This is used to match people up, invite them to specific topic/tool discussions or sessions, or set up curriculum for planned workshops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do participants think could improve mentorship?&lt;/strong&gt; There is some overlap in suggested solutions here, particularly the suggestion for forum-style, centralized discussion interface and for better documentation of various resources and FAQs. Participant suggestions range from simpler (left/green) to the more complex (right/red).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/improve-mentorship.png&quot; alt=&quot;Improving Mentorship.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communications-2&quot;&gt;Communications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some relatively quicker fixes we can make to make our on wiki communications options more accessible, intuitive, and visible to our community, especially on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a higher level, our Product teams need to weigh the pros and cons of making on wiki the go-to place for all wiki-related communications or acknowledge that on wiki is simply not meant to be that type of all-encompassing destination and support off wiki channels where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other general considerations include device and data limitations many of our community members and potential users face, differing cultural tendencies (e.g, security, privacy, building trust) and community-specific norms around policing, attitudes towards newcomers/anonymous users, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mentorship-2&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communications ecosystem’s visibility and functionality are the foundation for mentorship to develop, flourish, and sustain. The functionality aspect should increasingly address not just transactional forms of newcomer help/training (documentation pages, FAQs, bots) but also allow for organic growth of mentorship connections and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When mentorship connections do not arise organically, such as in structured newcomer programs, the resulting mentorship interactions tend to remain more transactional in nature and lack an inspirational element that fosters feelings of ownership and more naturally creates opportunities for challenge/reward dynamics to arise. These are factors that tend to establish additional connections, interests, and overall a more prolonged, lasting relationship with the mentor and the movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next-planning-collaboration-evaluation&quot;&gt;What’s next? Planning, collaboration, evaluation.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prioritization and planning current/future roadmap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The findings inform ways (and focus areas) in which our Growth team’s Newcomer homepage/tasks initiatives can be improved and supplemented with concurrent efforts. The team can focus on ideation, prioritization, and planning for features in upcoming quarters/annual plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scoping &amp;amp; cross-team collaboration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Other Foundation teams may find this work relevant in their focus areas, both in and outside of Product. There are opportunities for the Growth team to coordinate with other teams (e.g. Editing, Android &amp;amp; iOS, Trust &amp;amp; Safety) on issues impacting communications and mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytics/UX evaluations of Newcomer initiatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As Growth team’s newcomer initiatives are rolled out on test wikis and perhaps additional wikis, evaluating on an iterative basis how the features are or aren’t meeting the needs of a variety of user personas, using both analytics and usability testing/interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-strategic-research&quot;&gt;Further strategic research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional relevant personas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The next phase of this research should include newcomers and mentees (specific subset of newcomers) more specifically. This will provide first-hand knowledge of how those first experiencing communications related to the wikis become aware of the variety of channels, their expectations and the realities, and their experiences of the newcomer initiatives and interactions with experienced users (in a general or specifically mentorship-type capacity) in these spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specific communities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Further research should include communities with limited device and connectivity and also cultural concerns whereby trust is primarily built through in-person connections to see what support possibilities exist.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Where and how wiki users are communicating with one another, and how mentorship manifests within the communication ecosystem.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/header.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/assets/uploads/understanding-wiki-communications/header.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Wikipedia and Apps: A Love Story</title><link href="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/08/wikipedia-and-apps-a-love-story.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wikipedia and Apps: A Love Story" /><published>2021-12-08T07:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-08T07:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/08/wikipedia-and-apps-a-love-story</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/12/08/wikipedia-and-apps-a-love-story.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scblr&quot;&gt;Robin Schoenbaechler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/carolynlimadeo&quot;&gt;Carolyn Li-Madeo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/baba786&quot;&gt;Sudhanshu Gautam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Volker_E&quot;&gt;Volker E.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing for mobile apps presents unique challenges and opportunities compared to traditional websites. Mobile apps run natively on a device and have access to system resources that are harder to access within a web based architecture. Key characteristics of apps are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apps are designed to fit with the rest of the operating system. When an app fits in with the rest of the OS, it not only looks and feels more at home, it lowers the users learning curve.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A deep integration with the OS comes with benefits right out of the box, e.g. accessibility, performance, integration with voice assistants or &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/blog/2021/04/26/bringing-wikipedia-to-the-homescreen-on-ios.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;home screen widgets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offline capabilities and often reduced data usage: offline capabilities allow users to consume content from anywhere, even when they are not connected to the internet or connectivity is low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wikimedia Foundation’s apps are an essential piece to meet our &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/design-principles.html#this-is-for-everyone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“this is for everyone” design principle&lt;/a&gt;. Wikimedia apps are designed with the philosophy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobile-first.abookapart.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mobile first&lt;/a&gt; in mind. One of the core principles of mobile first is to embrace the constraints of a mobile environment and with it, prioritize essential information, as there’s simply not enough room for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited connectivity of people in certain areas of the world inspires us to create products that are performant and light on data. When building new features for people using mobile apps, we strive for excellency in user experience and aim to break down complex existing flows and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Wikipedia app on kaiOS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;strategy&quot;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The apps are here to create mobile first experiences&lt;/strong&gt; and are not trying to replace existing desktop or community tools. Through the apps, we aim to meet potential users where they are. We are interested in understanding and addressing barriers of those that have been historically left behind, while not compromising the integrity of the workflows of our long-time users on other platforms. Making participation fit naturally the mobile first lives we live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The apps are a place to experiment.&lt;/strong&gt; Due to development speed, richer capabilities and unique needs of our user base, we are able to experiment. It is on the apps where we think the future of mobile editing will be discovered. Notably, the apps are where we piloted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Suggested_edits#Welcome_to_Suggested_edits&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;micro contributions&lt;/a&gt;, our most successful editing intervention to this date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The apps are a forcing function to make our technologies future proof.&lt;/strong&gt; To provide an example: Right now Wikipedia’s web experience works as a website only and cannot be exported to new mediums. By building on the apps, we create technology that is platform independent and enables next generation experiences. Whether these use artificial intelligence, augmented reality or future technology that is changing our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;theming&quot;&gt;Theming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikipedia-and-apps-a-love-story/theming.png&quot; alt=&quot;Theming.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the introduction, iOS and Android both have platform specific guidelines. When building apps for the global Wikimedia movement, our goal is to create native experiences for the specific platform. When designing for mobile apps, guidelines for the platform sit at the top of the hierarchy. Throughout Wikimedia’s product suite, we follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/visual-style.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Design’s visual design principles&lt;/a&gt; when providing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a seamless and familiar experience within Wikimedia’s products and services, we apply theming that is based on Wikimedia’s visual style guidelines. Theming allows us to customize the app’s look and feel, to better represent our product’s brand. Theming is reflected in the entire UI, including individual components, like buttons. Here’s an example of applying Material Theming in the Wikipedia Android app:&lt;/p&gt;

Since both the Android and iOS Wikipedia app is available in four different reading themes (Light, Sepia, Dark and Black), they are using an enhanced color palette for an optimal reading experience. Check out more details about the color palette for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Android_theme_guidelines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://diff.wikimedia.org/2017/12/04/ios-app-dark-theme/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;

The app’s mostly use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/visual-style_icons.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;icons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; provided by the platform, e.g. from &lt;a href=&quot;hhttps://material.io/design/iconography&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Material&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Apple Human Interface Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, except for icons that are associated with established Wikimedia products or services (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/OOUI_icons#userTalk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia’s icon for user talk pages&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How clear is the goal? Based on Wikimedia Design’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/design-principles.html#content-first&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“content first” principle&lt;/a&gt;, we aim to &lt;strong&gt;design apps that are easy to understand and focus on the essential&lt;/strong&gt;. When designing, content comes first, control comes second. On mobile, screen real estate is limited, places of usage are unforeseeable and the user’s focus is reduced. We strive to reduce information density while not neglecting an interface’s functional essence. Guiding questions like: What is the essence of this feature? What is the purpose of this particular screen? How much information can be deprioritized (or left out) to convey a UI’s purpose? Clarity stands for designing user interfaces with clear call to actions, generous use of white space, accessible contrast and hierarchy when designing with type or icons. Writing concise and suitable multilingual UI copy supports in reaching their goals more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where am I? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/design-principles.html#design-for-consistency&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Design for consistency and orientation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are key aspects to help users navigate through an interface in a mobile app. We put explicit effort in communicating where users are and where they can go. Spatial awareness in a digital product helps users in achieving goals more directly. This is exemplified by using a consistent navigation, usage of depth and the application of motion. Deliberate usage of animation and transitions help users navigate an interface. Visual layers and realistic motion convey hierarchy, emotion and understanding when using a device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emotion&quot;&gt;Emotion&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the design feel on an emotional level? An often forgotten and invisible theme but yet one of the most impactful: emotional design. Along the lines of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/design-principles.html#trustworthy-yet-joyful&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;”trustworthy yet joyful” design principle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;we believe that preserving the human touch and showing ourselves with our values in our work is essential&lt;/strong&gt;. Especially on a device that is as personal as your mobile phone. Instead of creating one more cheap and fast mass feature, we follow a philosophy that has been paved by artists, designers, and architects of the arts and crafts movement. After all, we design for humans and strive to create humane and emotional experiences. Through design, we can see and connect with other human beings. To design experiences that are emotional, we consider understanding the needs of the people we are designing for, as the core mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ergonomics&quot;&gt;Ergonomics&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the design feel in my hand? &lt;strong&gt;Ergonomics, posture, context, and the tactile nature of touch have implications on how users interact with a design&lt;/strong&gt;. Our design principle “this is for everyone” is part of our core mission and designing for touch is different than designing for a keyboard, mouse or trackpad. When designing for apps, we embrace principles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;direct manipulation&lt;/a&gt;, an interaction model where effect are immediately visible on the screen to the user. Designing for a touch device goes beyond enlarging buttons for bigger fingers. We deeply consider placement and positioning of elements to achieve an ergonomic user experience while being aware of different device usage types. And, as voice is considered as the most natural machine-human input method available, we make sure the interface reflects it. We design experiences that provide ergonomics on smartphones, tablets and hybrid laptop/touch devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On most Wikipedias, you don’t need an account to make an edit. While there are benefits to making an account — such as a single place to see all communications, or a place to store articles that you’re interested in — there is no requirement to make one. This reduced barrier to entry means that people around the world can contribute to our projects — whether it’s a small typo fix or a new article — without ever having to make an account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it also means that it’s easier to vandalize and make destructive edits to our projects. To counter this, our editors and administrators patrol edits made by registered and unregistered editors alike. These watchful editors are also known as &lt;em&gt;patrollers&lt;/em&gt;. To keep out bad faith edits from our projects, patrollers need to have an understanding of who is making the edits. In the case of unregistered editors though, the information that they rely on most is their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An IP address is a unique address that is given to any device that is connected to a network like the Internet. When an unregistered user makes an edit, the change isn’t attributed to their name, but their device’s IP address instead. An IP address is like a home address, it cannot reveal your identity but one can deduce a lot about you by knowing where you live. So, what might seem to some as an &lt;em&gt;anonymous&lt;/em&gt; way of editing actually reveals more about them than a simple pseudonym would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrollers copy these IP addresses into external &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WHOIS tools&lt;/a&gt; to understand where the editor is coming from. These tools tell them information about where the editor might be and how they’re connecting to the Internet. To reduce the extra step of copy-pasting addresses, and providing a single place to get IP  information, the Anti-Harassment Tools team started work on an &lt;em&gt;IPInfo&lt;/em&gt; tool within Wikipedia. This tool would give our patrollers the needed information right where they need it — when analyzing an unregistered user’s contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;designing-ip-info&quot;&gt;Designing IP Info&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-research&quot;&gt;Initial Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we wanted to get a better understanding of the patrolling process and specifically how IP addresses are used while evaluating edits. To do this we conducted interviews with editors who often patrol our projects and asked them to show and talk us through their process. This gave us an overview of the different ways patrollers go about keeping our projects vandalism free. After a few rounds of feedback from design, research, engineers and Trust &amp;amp; Safety folks we had the following task model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/patrolling-unregistered-editors-on-wikipedia/ip-info-risk-vs-usefulness-matrix-wikimedia-design.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Task model for IP Patrolling on wikis.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Task model for IP Patrolling on wikis. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lmUSH8s=/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt; for a full view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand now that IP patrolling usually starts from RecentChanges, an editor’s Watchlist, or from a page that the editor knows gets vandalized often. When looking at the edits of such a page the patroller first looks for clear red flags like edit flooding (lots of minor edits in a short amount of time), no edit summary, large deletions etc. They then look for more specific on-wiki information like if the IP has a talk page, if it has ever been blocked, and its global and local contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this initial fact-finding, patrollers decide if an IP is worth looking into further. If it is, they use external tools to find more information about the IP. They’re looking for details  like — location, proxy usage and organization that the IP might be linked to. This process is not completely accurate since different databases have different information on the same IP. Oftentimes, based on the location of the IP and the location of the tool the editors are using, the information provided might vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, based on the information collected, patrollers decide which action would be most appropriate. Again, this decision takes into account various factors like the policies of that wiki, the scale of the collateral damage caused by a range block, consistency in editing patterns, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mock-ups&quot;&gt;Mock-ups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patrollers need on-wiki information about the IP before they decide to investigate it, so, we decided to add a popup that shows block and contribution information. The popup would be accessible by clicking an information icon next to the IP address on pages like RecentChanges, Watchlist and History.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/patrolling-unregistered-editors-on-wikipedia/ip-info-popup-wikimedia-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;The IP Info popup that’ll be accessible from pages like RecentChanges that patrollers monitor for edits.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The IP Info popup that’ll be accessible from pages like RecentChanges that patrollers monitor for edits.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the patroller decides to dig deeper into an IP address by going to their Contributions page, they’ll be able to see a collapsible box that shows more IP related information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/patrolling-unregistered-editors-on-wikipedia/ip-info-box-wikimedia-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;The IP Info box shown on the Contributions page gives detailed information to the patrollers.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The IP Info box shown on the Contributions page gives detailed information to the patrollers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing these mocks internally brought up three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much information is useful?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who should have access to this information?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should some patrollers have access to partial bits of information?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;balancing-needs&quot;&gt;Balancing needs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our projects have a wide variety of contributors and vary in socio-demography, accessibility and motivations. These and other factors were captured in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Knowledge_Gaps_Index/Taxonomy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Knowledge Gap Taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; research, which not only looked at the gaps in Wikipedia’s content but the gaps in the contributors as well. In turn, we reframed our design questions as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How might we make sure that revealing IP information doesn’t put our most marginalized contributors at risk?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How might we ensure that access to information and tools doesn’t become a barrier to contributions for our least technically skilled contributors?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While IP information needs to be available to all, we wanted to make sure that it doesn’t put anyone at risk and it isn’t so technical &amp;amp; overwhelming that it becomes meaningless to most patrollers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;team-workshop&quot;&gt;Team Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Anti-Harassment Tools team and the Trust &amp;amp; Safety teams came together for a small workshop to discuss these items. We acknowledged that we want both non-technical and technical users to have easy access to IP information. We also acknowledged that we can’t put our unregistered editors at risk especially because some of the IP information, like location and organization, can potentially help in identifying a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our discussions around accessibility for patrollers we noted questions and concerns around information overload, accuracy of information and false confidence in IP data. We also considered if having IP information more readily available might lead to its misuse. The following clusters began to form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data:&lt;/strong&gt; How might we make sure that people understand the data they’re looking at, and understand its accuracy too?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal information:&lt;/strong&gt; How might we make sure that information is accessible to those who need it, without putting unregistered editors at risk?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agency:&lt;/strong&gt; How might we inform unregistered editors of the data they are leaving traces of and show them ways to protect it (create an account)?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After brainstorming on the questions we started to organize our thoughts in the following manner — we need to balance the concerns of ease of use for patrollers and risk to unregistered editors. To do this we plotted the different pieces of IP information on a graph with Risk on the Y axis and Usefulness to patrolling on the X axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/patrolling-unregistered-editors-on-wikipedia/ip-info-task-model-wikimedia-design.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Task model for IP Patrolling on wikis.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Plotting the different pieces of IP information based on Risk (to editor) and Usefulness (to patroller). See &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lmUSH8s=/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt; for a full view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise was based on the learnings from research as well as the team’s experience. Two clear clusters appeared, the high risk one mostly containing information that could reveal an editor’s location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this, we are planning to show a limited set of information to most users and give access to more sensitive information to only our most trusted users — Administrators and CheckUsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;gathering-feedback&quot;&gt;Gathering feedback&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community-input&quot;&gt;Community input&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing our findings with the community led to some interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:IP_Editing:_Privacy_Enhancement_and_Abuse_Mitigation/IP_Info_feature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conversations and feedback&lt;/a&gt;. Some common themes were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing or deepening the scope of a particular piece of information. IP Information is complex and having more context and data usually helps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding more data sources to get a wider picture of the IP information. This would also help in figuring out if the data being shown is reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specific points about IP ranges and IPv6 addresses and how to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;usability-tests&quot;&gt;Usability tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also able to do some usability tests with Patrollers in the community. Overall, the feature was well-received and they liked that they won’t have to rely on external tools in the future. We were given some specific feedback around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The distribution of information between the popup and the box. Some information is more helpful in the popup to decide whether or not to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having more guidance on how to use this information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Showing some of this information on Diff pages so that editors have access to it while comparing revisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation is currently in the works and we’ll be rolling it out to wikis slowly as a BetaFeature, incorporating improvements based on usability testing. We’ll also be implementing feedback mechanisms in the tool so that we can learn more about how people are using the tool.

&lt;p&gt;Reading a Wikipedia article on a feature phone is time consuming. The article about Tiger might take 25-30 minutes to read on a smartphone; alternatively, it would take much longer to read on a feature phone. While smartphones are almost ubiquitous in some parts of the world, over 100M&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-1&quot; id=&quot;ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; people across the globe still use feature phones to connect to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikimedia has significant room to expand in emerging communities where access to inexpensive devices and cheap data is quickly growing. To help people overcome barriers to access free knowledge on our projects and be a trustworthy source of knowledge and information, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Inuka_team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inuka team&lt;/a&gt; at Wikimedia Foundation decided to improve the Wikipedia reading experience on feature phones to accommodate the unique needs and preferences of historically underrepresented users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-the-devices&quot;&gt;About the devices&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KaiOS, a mobile operating system based on HTML5 power these phones. It supports 4G/LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. India is one of the biggest markets for KaiOS, where it powers Jiophone. These phones have limited computing capabilities, small displays, and most actions are performed using a keypad. Their low cost, combined with the ability to use apps like Google, Facebook, Youtube, etc., make them a top choice among first-time internet users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the phone, all actions are presented on a softkey panel linked to physical keys on the keypad. Most actions are performed using center, left, and right hardware keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team started using feature phones to familiarize ourselves with keypad-based interactions, challenges when using apps, impact of limited infrastructure on user experience, and how the Wikipedia reading experience feels. In parallel, we worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hureo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hureo&lt;/a&gt;, a user research firm based in India, to conduct foundational research&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-2&quot; id=&quot;ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with 25 participants in different cities in India. Research aimed to learn about how they used these devices, their motivations to use them, their awareness of Wikipedia, and their experiences reading Wikipedia articles. These are some of the findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smart features, durability, and good battery life at an affordable price are the main reasons to use feature phones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primary usage is social media, entertainment, and look for information online.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wikipedia awareness is low. Informed users use it to read about famous people, entertainment, places to visit, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading a long Wikipedia article on its browser is quite laborious as typing and scrolling is difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participants mentioned that the small font size required extra effort to read, and caused strain on their eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For quick navigation, users wished to have easy access to the table of contents, images, and other parts of articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These insights from our research, combined with our own experiences and frustrations when reading Wikipedia articles on feature phones, indicated that we should try to provide a better reading experience for all of these people. These were the improvements we were interested in testing with users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An onboarding flow to define What Wikipedia is in simple language to users who may or may not have used it before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Brief onboarding to share about Wikipedia, language diversity, and the volume of articles available.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A “quick links panel” to directly access a section of an article, view images, or  read an article in different languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Quick links to access different parts of an article.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of continuous scrolling using the keypad while moving through an article, readers can read clear segments of a Wikipedia article on the small screen one page at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-we-learn&quot;&gt;What did we learn?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the pandemic, conducting remote sessions in India was quite challenging as screen sharing is not directly supported by KaiOS. Luckily, all participants had access to smartphones either through their family members or friends. Twenty participants(12 Male, 8 Females) were recruited within the 20 to 40 years age group. Interviews were conducted in English, Hindi, Marathi, and Telugu to cover language diversity. Usability tasks involved installing the app, searching &amp;amp; reading an article of their choice, and any additional feedback to improve the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of session learnings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users appreciated the ease of discovering articles in multiple languages and the simplicity of changing the app language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can change before searching only. I will use this feature because I can use it  whenever I want to read in Marathi. - User 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users liked quick links to help them access different sections of an article, view images, and quickly access important facts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is part of the same article. This is like a shortcut, so from here I can read any topic related to the article. - User 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users were confused when certain articles were unavailable when they changed the app language to their regional language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I search for ‘Dosa recipe in hindi’ using voice search I get the results, here maybe the information is available in English only and not Hindi. - User 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users could not understand the icon used for quick facts and considered it a map icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I expected to see a map here, as the icon used for it was of a location. - User 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most users did not read the onboarding descriptions as they mostly ignore that part in other apps too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app was first released in India in September 2020 and was later released globally in December 2020. It has been downloaded over 2.5M times since its first release. In the next update, we are looking forward to improving article discovery and the overall reading experience. Improvements would include contextual onboarding to quickly start the app, a trending article list to find content beyond search functionality, and other minor changes to improve issues observed during usability sessions. Stay tuned for all the amazing work the Inuka team does to support new internet users in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people don’t realize that along with Wikipedia, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimediafoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; hosts a number of other projects, ranging from reference projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page&quot;&gt;Wiktionary&lt;/a&gt; to software projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki&quot;&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt;. These projects belong to everyone and like Wikipedia, are free to use to further our goal of providing the essential infrastructure for free knowledge &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt; is one of these projects and is the world’s largest free-to-use library of illustrations, photos, drawings, videos, and music. Wikimedia Commons hosts more than 71 million freely usable media files&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-1&quot; id=&quot;ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to which anyone can contribute. It also hosts and organizes a majority of the media you encounter on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, one of the tasks of the structured data team, a cross-functional product team at the Wikimedia Foundation, was to focus on how to improve the search experience on Wikimedia Commons to better surface all of the media files contributed by people from around the world. One of the key tenets of this work was making the experience less intimidating, in particular to those not familiar with Wikimedia Commons. Being able to support a wide range of use-cases, from power users like museums digitizing their photography collection to a high school student using Wikimedia Commons for the first time to find free usable media to complete a science project, was critical to building a successful search experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One obvious area the team focused on was ways to improve search accuracy since it doesn’t matter what you do with the presentation if the actual results aren’t mapping to the expectations of the searcher. However, this article, being written by the designer on the team, will be focused on the work that was done to ensure a much better experience that was created to complement these improved search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the average person hears that I’m the designer on the Growth team for Wikipedia, there’s a common misconception that it’s about growing the number of readers, the more commonly thought of “Wikipedia user”. However, our team was formed almost three years ago with a different challenge and audience as our focus. This article aims to tell the six-part story of how and why we started this team, and all the failures, learnings, and successes we’ve had since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;baseline-research&quot;&gt;Baseline research&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/Special_Search_on_Commons.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Special Search on Commons&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Largely untouched in its 17-year history, a screenshot of search on Wikimedia Commons before we started this project. | &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Special_Search_on_Commons.jpg&quot;&gt;Special Search on Commons&lt;/a&gt; | Public Domain&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kicked this project off with a round of research to get a more honest understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of search on Wikimedia Commons. With only a few quotes from the participants of this research, you can see what we were up against:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is so much text and details, it was hard to find what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was frustrating to find all of the advanced search options, I figured it out after a while but didn’t expect to find them where I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t feel like a very nice display of results…difficult to see the details and evaluate the results with such small images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It feels complicated and the images are hard to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s extra work to  navigate back and forth between the file page and search to get everything I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t trust it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can read, there was room for improvement. We needed to make the search experience more familiar and easy to use. Image search on the web is not a novel problem but the uniqueness of search on Wikimedia Commons was detrimental to casual users and those not intimately familiar with the project. With over 3 million daily page views&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-2&quot; id=&quot;ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on Wikimedia Commons, it’s more than obvious we needed to build a tool that made sense to everyone and aligned closer to their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also knew that our most passionate contributors to the Wikimedia Commons project needed certain features and tools to help with their work. Would it be possible to make an experience that both catered to those unfamiliar with Wikimedia Commons and those that use it every day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-more-functional-and-familiar-interface&quot;&gt;Creating a more functional and familiar interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/Search_on_Wikimedia_Commons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the search experience on Wikimedia Commons&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Upon clicking of a result, you can see more information in a “quick view panel” | &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Search_on_Wikimedia_Commons.jpg&quot;&gt;Search on Wikimedia Commons with Quick View&lt;/a&gt; | By Matthew Williams | &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working through a myriad of wireframes, ideas, and approaches with the team, we began to arrive at some key areas we were going to focus on. One of the more visually obvious changes we started with was moving towards a grid layout that more effectively uses the space and highlights the media shown. Even with images around twice as large, we are able to show around three times as many results before needing to scroll. With as many results as we have, this helped users more quickly parse what Wikimedia Commons has to offer. Other interface improvements included surfacing all the different media types available upfront, making filters easier to find and use, and adding more information to a “quick view panel” upon clicking to eliminate the need to leave the page as often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/Media_Search_and_Other_File_Types.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshots of Media Search while searching for other file types&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also separated the different types of media files into tabs. It became clear throughout the conversations with research participants that combining all file types into one result set was overwhelming, especially when the majority of visitors just wanted to search for images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/Media_Search_on_Mobile_Web.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshots of the search experience of Commons on Mobile Web&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 30% of all Wikimedia Commons usage&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-3&quot; id=&quot;ref-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on mobile web, we also wanted to make sure that all of these improvements were considered and easy to use on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;community-input&quot;&gt;Community Input&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear from research and usability studies that we were making progress with those less familiar with Wikimedia Commons, but what about those who use it the most frequently, like the countless contributors and volunteers, galleries, libraries, and museums?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new search experience was designed and built with these communities’ involvement from the ground up, with Wikimedia Commons contributors involved from conception and design to prototyping to the final push for feature completion prior to launch. The team planned a robust feedback cycle for sharing, bringing in information, iterating, and communicating with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community involvement began in May 2020 with sharing the ideas and designs, and by June the community was using a prototype. Over the next nine months, the development team would go through six distinct feedback cycles, with a total of 24 community members participating and leaving detailed ideas, comments, concerns, and questions to improve the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial feedback was positive and helped us refine many aspects of the new experience. For example, one of the many pieces of useful feedback was a request for a filter that was able to search specifically for images that had received an assessment. Assessments are a system that the community has created to recognize important contributions across Wikimedia Commons, with groupings such as featured pictures, valued images, quality images, and picture of the day. This filter in particular was an excellent suggestion that we were able to implement that really sets Wikimedia Commons apart from other image searching tools with its human-powered curation at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making significant progress, we completed a wide array of usability tests to understand if the answers and changes we had applied from the initial baseline research were actually improving the experience. Here are some of the quotes from those interviews:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much clearer and simpler to use. I prefer this version because the images are bigger. There were so many details in the old search that it was hard to see what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is comparatively much simpler and clearer to understand, with less space wasted in this format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It feels easier because it requires less clicking and the options are more visible. It also had more images to see at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is more intuitive, user friendly and easier to navigate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This feels much easier to operate and it is comfortable to use. It was much simpler in style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also conducted a survey in late December 2020/early January 2021, asking users directly if they had a preference for the new search experience or legacy search. We received 40 responses, again showing a preference for the new search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the evidence from that research and analysis, as well as the qualitative and quantitative feedback from the community, we decided to make this new search experience the default search on Wikimedia Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this update, we hope to have made finding and discovering this amazing treasure trove of freely usable media on the internet just a bit easier while honoring all of the hard work and contributions people around the world have made to Wikimedia Commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the average person hears that I’m the designer on the Growth team for Wikipedia, there’s a common misconception that it’s about growing the number of readers, the more commonly thought of “Wikipedia user”.  However, our team was formed almost three years ago with a different challenge and audience as our focus. This article aims to tell the six-part story of how and why we started this team, and all the failures, learnings, and  successes we’ve had since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify the problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plant the seeds for Growth: Research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The set up: Team process &amp;amp; principles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design experiments 1, 2, and 3: Down, up, and up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now what? Doubling down and scaling up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What’s next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-identify-the-problem&quot;&gt;1. Identify the problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s commonly known that Wikipedia is a multilingual project, one thing that may be surprising is how much variation there is between articles on the same topic in different languages. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canel%C3%A9&quot;&gt;French canelé article&lt;/a&gt; has a fairly different history on the origins for the small pastries than its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canel%C3%A9&quot;&gt;English version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-1&quot; id=&quot;ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is because each article version is written by its own community of editors, not machine translated&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-2&quot; id=&quot;ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The diversity and breadth of content across around 300 languages is awesome, but it also presents a challenge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How might we grow knowledge across all languages?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Currently the largest Wikipedia language is English, with ~6.3 million articles&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-3&quot; id=&quot;ref-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Contrast this with the Hindi version (the 4th most spoken first-language, just behind English&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-4&quot; id=&quot;ref-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) with ~147K articles&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-5&quot; id=&quot;ref-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This highlights the many knowledge gaps that exist on Wikipedia – and how it is a massive barrier to information access for those who don’t know English. To continue on the case of the canelé, (as of writing) there is no article about the deliciously rich heritage of these pastries documented on Hindi Wikipedia at all. Or to give a more ‘serious’ example of the knowledge gap (though one would argue pastries are a culturally significant item), the Hindi edition also lacks biographies for prominent figures like Nobel laureate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ir%C3%A8ne_Joliot-Curie&quot;&gt;Irène Joliot-Curie&lt;/a&gt;, or conservationist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dian_Fossey&quot;&gt;Dian Fossey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wikimedia Foundation’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/vision/&quot;&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; is to ensure that every single human being can freely share in the world’s knowledge, which can only be accomplished if more people contribute to that corpus of knowledge across all languages. Unfortunately Wikipedia has seen the number of contributors (a.k.a. editors) either stagnate or shrink over the years, and struggle to attract and retain new folks. A notable metric is that around 94% of first time editors don’t ever stick around to make a second edit&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-6&quot; id=&quot;ref-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The Growth team was formed at the Wikimedia Foundation in July 2018 to directly address this problem. There need to be significant increases in the number of contributors  as well as a more diverse contributor pool in order to supply knowledge that is relevant to everyone in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the Growth team’s objective is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase contributor &lt;strong&gt;activation&lt;/strong&gt; (people who make a first edit)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase contributor &lt;strong&gt;retention&lt;/strong&gt; (people who come back another day to make subsequent edits)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also concentrated on working with smaller-to-medium sized Wikipedias to help promote the diversity of the contributors (rather than the larger, established language Wikipedias who tend to be an established homogenous group).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-planting-the-seeds-for-growth-research&quot;&gt;2. Planting the seeds for Growth: Research&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inception of our work actually began a year earlier with the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/New_Editor_Experiences&quot;&gt;New Editor Experiences&lt;/a&gt;” research project in 2017. This was a foundational research project aimed at learning as much as possible about new editors in Korean and Czech Wikipedias – two languages chosen as representative of many smaller Wikipedias. The project was conducted not only in collaboration with a research partner Reboot, but also with Wikipedians in Korea and Czech, with a “Community ambassador” role created for a long-term active member in each language, to encourage their communities’ participation in the project. In all, 64 interviews were conducted in Korea and Czechia to draw out a number of important insights about new editors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/nurturing-newbies/new-editor-research.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a page of the new editors experiences research.&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Left: &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:New_Editor_Experiences_summary_of_findings,_August_2017.pdf&amp;amp;page=12&quot;&gt;New Editor Experiences summary of findings, August 2017 - Page 12&lt;/a&gt; | By Reboot and the Wikimedia Foundation | &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC-BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt; || Right: &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:New_Editor_Experiences_user_personas,_August_2017.pdf&quot;&gt;New Editor Experiences user personas, August 2017 - Page 1&lt;/a&gt; | By Reboot and the Wikimedia Foundation | &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC-BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the outcomes of the research was identifying that contributors have very different motivations for editing (represented in the personas). Despite their differences, all these newcomer personas encountered one or more of these key barriers to editing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical barrier (e.g. How do I write in code?)&lt;/strong&gt; – Newcomers have trouble finding and using editing tools.  A lot of our editing tools can seem too overwhelmingly open-ended and complex for them to know where to even start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conceptual barrier (e.g. What is “notability”?)&lt;/strong&gt; – How do they write the “Wikipedia way”? What does it mean when their subject is not notable enough? What is NPOV?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural (e.g. Why are people so mean?)&lt;/strong&gt; – Newcomers are often unaware of the collaborative effort involved in writing Wikipedia. In turn, they can’t easily become part of the “community” of established and active editors, because they don’t know it exists. And for many, their first interaction is not positive because it’s someone telling them they did something wrong, or reverting their edit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the different newcomer needs, motivations, and challenges being surfaced, the research concluded with a number of recommendations. This was where the Growth team came into the picture, as it was formed to take action on these recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our aim was to experiment with design interventions to drive increases in activation and retention of newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-the-set-up-team-process-and-principles&quot;&gt;3. The set up: Team process and principles&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanilla Ice once sang, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ice_Baby&quot;&gt;Stop, collaborate and listen&lt;/a&gt;”. Our team works according to similar principles, but in a different order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-collaborate-in-the-open&quot;&gt;1. Collaborate in the open&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelling on the success of the New Editor Experiences research approach, a core part of our process is to ensure close communication and collaboration with the communities in which we work. The first thing we did when the team was formed was to partner with four “pilot” languages (Korean, Czech, Arabic, and Vietnamese) that we would collaborate with in controlled experiments. In addition to the team’s Community Relations Specialist (a liaison between Wikimedia product teams and volunteer community members), we created a “Community Ambassador” role for each pilot language – a representative who helps us to collaborate with their respective members on a range of tasks such as translation, communicating our progress, and recruiting others to participate in our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, not only do we collaborate with our communities, but because it’s Wikipedia – anyone can be a part of the community – so we work in the public. We post in-progress designs and engineering updates that anyone interested can react to and give feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-listen&quot;&gt;2. Listen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We listen to all the feedback coming back on our work, from usability testing on early stage designs through to analysing data from our released experiments in order to decide how to improve. We also listen to our community partners, and try to ensure there is sufficient flexibility and adaptability in designs to work for different groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-stop-if-its-not-working&quot;&gt;3. Stop (if it’s not working)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very important work principle we try to keep in mind is that experiments fail. When we see something is not working, we try to make a clean stop and take learnings from that failure to make the next experiment better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, nested in this last principle is making sure we are measuring results rigorously, and running &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups&quot;&gt;controlled experiments&lt;/a&gt; for everything we try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4-design-experiments-1-2-and-3-down-up-and-up&quot;&gt;4. Design experiments 1, 2, and 3: Down, up, and up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate our process and journey, I’d like to talk about three key experiments our team has worked on based on major recommendations from the design research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-help-panel-a-helpful-failure&quot;&gt;#1 Help panel: A helpful failure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/nurturing-newbies/growth-help-panel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshots of the help panel&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshots of the Help panel open over the “Hamlet” article from four Wikipedia languages (left to right: Arabic, Czech, Korean, and Vietnamese). | Text from Wikimedia projects are &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;CC-BY-SA-3.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our first experiments was based on research recommendations for better &lt;strong&gt;in-context help&lt;/strong&gt; (small doses of help relevant to the activity being done at that moment), as well as &lt;strong&gt;human-to-human help&lt;/strong&gt; (providing a real connection to a friendly person in the community). In a nutshell, the feature was a help panel tool available to newcomers when they opened an article for editing, and allowed them to search and/or ask questions to experienced users about how to edit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for this design to work in practice, not only did we consult with all our pilot wikis for buy-in on the idea, via our ambassadors, but we needed these very experienced editors from each language to sign up to answer questions. So community engagement was doubly important for this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engagement with the help panel was quite high&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-7&quot; id=&quot;ref-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; considering its ancillary placement and function, so we considered it a positive sign that newcomers want in-context and human help.  An interesting tidbit was that there were cultural differences in the usage, where Koreans asked very few questions compared to the other pilot wikis. However, per our “Stop if it’s not working” principle, we ultimately didn’t see any change in more people starting to edit or being retained, so we paused further iteration and went to try a different idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-newcomer-homepage-a-welcoming-place&quot;&gt;#2 Newcomer homepage: A welcoming place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Newcomer homepage was the second project built as a result of  the usability testing of our earlier work, where we noticed a lot of test participants expected a dashboard or some homepage to orient themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we created this “newcomer homepage” that gives them that clear place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its first iteration, it contained a few different modules that help someone learn about editing, encourage them to create a user page, and seek help from both the help desk or from a specific experienced editor assigned as their mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was encouraging to see people engaging with this page and returning to it on multiple days to take different actions. One of our most important observations was that the most popular button was for creating a “user page”, which is like a user profile in which newcomers can identify themselves to others.  The engagement with this button gave us a very strong signal that newcomers will start contributing if given a call-to-action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-newcomer-tasks-suggestions-to-get-started&quot;&gt;#3 Newcomer tasks: Suggestions to get started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural next step after seeing newcomers interacting and seeking out editing actions on the newcomer homepage was to give them opportunities to edit actual Wikipedia articles. We did this in the form of newcomer task recommendations, a feature we call “Suggested edits” on the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on foundational research and cumulative feedback from previous experiments, we knew that many newcomers either arrive with a very challenging edit in mind (e.g., write a new article from scratch) from which failure becomes a demoralising dead-end, or else they don’t have any edits in mind at all, and never find their footing as contributors. The “Suggested edits” module offers tasks ranging from easy tasks (like copyediting or adding links), to harder tasks (like adding citations or expanding articles) that newcomers can filter to based on their specific interests (e.g., copyedit articles about “Food and drink”). This feature is intended to cater to both groups – a clear way to start editing for those who don’t know what they want to do, and for those who do have a difficult edit in mind, it provides a learning pathway to build up their skills first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/nurturing-newbies/suggested-edit-mobile.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshots of Suggested edits on mobile&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its launch, and as we added more editing guidance and improvements to the homepage design over multiple iterations and variant tests (a subject for another post), we’ve seen steady increases in edits and number of editors using it. In other words, the release of this experimental feature saw us succeed in increasing editor activation and retention. 🙌 🙌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5-now-what--doubling-down-and-scaling-up&quot;&gt;5. Now what?  Doubling down and scaling up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success we saw in the pilot languages meant that we are able to work on the next great problem to solve: how can we scale up and encourage all the other Wikipedias to adopt our features?&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-8&quot; id=&quot;ref-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Luckily, one of the benefits of working in this somewhat slow-and-steady approach is that as the team consults with the different language communities, we’ve got a lot of supporting data and built up a lot of trust from collaborating with our pilot communities which has helped encourage many language communities to sign up. To date, we’ve added the features to 35 Wikipedias, which, when accounting for the relative sizes of the languages, amounting to nearly half (42% to be exact) of all newcomers to Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the time it has taken from the initial failed experiment with the help panel to the modest success we’ve had so far in increasing new contributors, these were my biggest realisations about what it is to design with and for the open community of communities that is Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance of collaborating with communities for adoption &amp;amp; understanding.&lt;/strong&gt; Collaborating with our communities is paramount for trust, acceptance, and improved user experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimenting with an open mind&lt;/strong&gt; (and being ready to fail with a next plan).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no one size fits all for everyone.&lt;/strong&gt; Accepting that actually, there is no perfect design for everyone. Seeing how different cultures and languages react to and use the same design differently has made me realise the importance of allowing a degree of customization, to empower different communities to figure out what’s best for them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change takes time and perseverance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;6-whats-next&quot;&gt;6. What’s next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now established a good cadence to our experiment-and-scale-up-on-success approach, and as the Growth team features become available on more Wikipedias, our ultimate goal is that one day these will no longer be experiments but a core part of welcoming editors to the Wikipedia community. So, mission accomplished right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thankfully, my job as a designer is not done here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that all the design interventions so far have been about trying to get newcomers to succeed by giving them access to help and suggestions to edit using the existing editing interface. At the moment, if someone selects a suggested edit to “copy edit” an article, they don’t receive any specific pointers about what part of the article needs help with fixing spelling or grammar. Our newcomers still need to know which of the many editing tools they should be using, and will often need to ask for more guidance. And that’s what instigated our team’s latest design exploration: &lt;strong&gt;Structured tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that instead of guiding people through the current complex, open-ended editing UI, we create new, easier ways to edit. And we will do this by breaking down editing tasks you can do on Wikipedia into a series of single smaller steps or “structured tasks” instead. Something that newcomers can quickly and easily accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first structured task that we have designed is to review suggestions by an algorithm to make words in a Wikipedia article link to other articles, and we are again approaching this by seeing how this new task type is working firstly for our pilot Wikipedias by the start of June 2021. I’m anxiously optimistic about  how this next experiment goes, fodder for  another post, but until then (and until there’s time for another blog post), you can learn more about our work on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Growth&quot;&gt;team page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;note-1&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;Digression: As of 2021-05-17, the French version of the Canelé article talks about its creation being connected to wine production in the Bordeaux region: since only egg whites were used in the “fining” wine process, the excess egg yolks were used in canelé-making. This is contrasted with the English article which focuses on the origins of the name, and is much more circumspect about its origins.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;note-2&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;Wikipedia does, however, also offer a pretty great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Content_translation&quot;&gt;Content Translation&lt;/a&gt; tool that helps multilingual people translate articles into different languages they know.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;note-8&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;Some of you may be flummoxed that it is a necessary step at all to encourage the different communities to adopt our features. This is one of the interesting things about designing for Wikipedia! Communities have the option to not adopt the features we create, literally being able to change or turn off features if their particular community has not reached consensus. This is what makes developing trust and collaboration particularly vital, and also helps explain our slower pace of change.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Apple introduced an update to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/widgets&quot;&gt;widgets&lt;/a&gt; with iOS 14, the Wikipedia iOS team was excited to take the opportunity to rethink our own. With the ability to place widgets right on the home screen, the team was curious about how we could highlight Wikipedia content in a way that was visually engaging, glanceable and up-to-date. For our first suite of home screen widgets, we built off of elements from the app’s Explore Feed to design and build three new widgets for iOS 14: On this day, Picture of the day and Top read on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we’ll share some of our widget building process – from design to implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikipedia-widget/wikipedia-ios-widgets.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of various iOS widgets&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Widget designs we explored throughout our product process&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;design-principles-for-the-wikipedia-ios-widgets&quot;&gt;Design principles for the Wikipedia iOS widgets&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iOS team defined the following design principles at the start of the project, which helped us to decide what features to highlight in our new widgets as well as to prioritize features like dark mode and supporting all three sizes for each of our widgets. These principles also guided the visual and interaction design of the widgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;content-first&quot;&gt;Content first&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design principle comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/design-principles.html#trustworthy-yet-joyful&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Design Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People come to Wikimedia projects for their content. Our solutions should help to facilitate its creation, consumption, and sharing — without getting in the way. Our content (facts, images, quotes, etc.) is our most representative element, and needs to be emphasized in our solutions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to applying this principle to our widgets, we used this guidance to place a strong focus on the beautiful images and community written content in our widgets. Great encyclopedic content is why many people love Wikipedia and we wanted to ensure that our designs placed Wikipedia content front and center, with other design elements like graphs and headings taking a supporting role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focused&quot;&gt;Focused&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home screens can easily become cluttered or distracting. With so many different apps, widgets and notifications pulling readers in different directions each time that they open their phone, we didn’t want to add to the noise or create unnecessary friction. We aimed to design widgets that were beautiful, glanceable and focused on a single element or content type from Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynamic&quot;&gt;Dynamic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikimedia projects are constantly changing and evolving. The projects are shaped by volunteer contributors from across the world. Readers also make their mark on Wikipedia, by following their unique interests and learning more about current events. With this in mind we want to highlight and celebrate the liveliness of Wikipedia with designs that reflect the dynamic nature of the Wikimedia projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;customizable&quot;&gt;Customizable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widgets can come in three sizes (small, medium and large) and two reading themes (light and dark). We want to ensure that our readers can access the information that they are interested in, in a layout and theme that works well for them. Building off of the frameworks provided by Apple, we want to ensure that people can read comfortably (and in their preferred language, when available), regardless of the time of day or night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;designing-the-wikipedia-ios-widgets&quot;&gt;Designing the Wikipedia iOS widgets&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came time to begin designing our widgets, we looked to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10103/&quot;&gt;WWDC 2020 talk on designing widgets&lt;/a&gt; and the information available through &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/widgets&quot;&gt;Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. We wanted to ensure that whatever widgets we designed would adhere not only to our defined design principles but also to Apple’s design guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some key takeaways from Apple’s guidelines were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Utilize a standard margin of 16pts for comfortable reading and design consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on highlighting content that will change often to avoid widgets becoming stale.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create designs for both light and dark mode, or focus on creating designs that will work in both reading modes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase information with each widget size. Larger widgets should contain more information than their size small counterparts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SF Pro should be used over custom fonts so that widgets look at home with widgets from other apps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember that the associated app’s name will appear under each widget, so it isn’t necessary to include app icons or  app names on the widget itself unless the widget is related to a content aggregator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shapes inside of a widget should match the corner radius of the widget.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be mindful of how many deep links each widget size supports. As small widgets only support a single deep link, while there may be room to include more information, small widgets will only be able to link to a single location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We utilized the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/&quot;&gt;templates provided in the Human Interface Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; to jumpstart the sketching process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-the-picture-of-the-day-widget&quot;&gt;Designing the Picture of the day widget&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikipedia-widget/wikipedia-picture-of-the-day-widget.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the picture of the day widget&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    The Picture of the day widget features beautiful, hi-res imagery from Wikimedia Commons&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vulpes_vulpes_Mallnitz_01.jpg?fastcci_from=2194179&amp;amp;c1=2194179&amp;amp;c2=3943817&amp;amp;d1=15&amp;amp;d2=0&amp;amp;s=200&quot;&gt;Vulpes vulpes image&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Uoaei1&quot;&gt;Uoaei1&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first widget we designed was the Picture of the day widget. We wanted to start with something that would be easy to implement but also visually striking. Every day, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt; community selects a freely usable image to be the ‘Picture of the day.’ These high-resolution images range from composite images of &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Acropoclipse.jpg&quot;&gt;lunar eclipses&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Glaciar_Margerie,_Parque_Nacional_Bah%C3%ADa_del_Glaciar,_Alaska,_Estados_Unidos,_2017-08-19,_DD_33.jpg&quot;&gt;striking landscapes&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:D%C3%BClmen,_Wildpark_--_2015_--_8894-8.jpg&quot;&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt; (and much more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When designing this widget we wanted to make sure that the beautiful images were given as much room as possible, with other necessary information (like copyright and the widget title) coming second. This widget really embodies our design principle of ‘Content first’ by placing an emphasis on imagery over secondary information. When designing this widget, we also had to consider how cropping might affect different aspect ratios and photo subjects. With each increase in widget size, more of the image is shown and on the largest size the first three lines of the image description are also displayed. Tapping on the widget in any size deep links you into a full screen view of the featured image in the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this design, we did not make separate light and dark mode designs as the content is full bleed and we typically display description text over a dark background in the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikipedia-widget/wikipedia-on-this-day-widget.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of on this day widget&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    The On this day widget highlights an event that occurred on this day in history
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love helping to ignite new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_rabbit_hole&quot;&gt;rabbit holes&lt;/a&gt; for our readers, so we created a widget that would change each day and encourage readers to check out an article they might not have read before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of this widget was based off of the ‘On this day’ card from the app’s Explore feed. Both the widget and the Explore feed card highlight the work of Wikipedia’s volunteer editors, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Selected_anniversaries&quot;&gt;compile and annotate lists of important events throughout history&lt;/a&gt; for each day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering how to adapt this feature from the app to the three widget sizes, we began first with the largest widget size. The largest widget size allowed us to include multiple tap targets (linking directly to the associated article or to a timeline view of the day’s events) and to include a splash of typography that illustrates the day’s date and date range. Including the timeline element also helped to create a sense of continuity between the widget and the existing feature on the app which utilizes the same timeline design. With the smaller widgets we focused more on the event text (removing the card representing the related article) and utilized a single tap target for both of these sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the feature is already available on the app in &lt;a href=&quot;https://diff.wikimedia.org/2017/12/04/ios-app-dark-theme/&quot;&gt;our four reading themes&lt;/a&gt;, it was easy to support both light and dark modes for this widget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikipedia-widget/wikipedia-on-this-day-widget-changes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of changes made&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Changes made after receiving feedback from designers at Apple
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing a first draft of our widgets, we received some very helpful feedback from the designers at Apple, who suggested we move the puck on the timeline up in order to better mimic the widget’s corner radius. It was a change of just a few pixels, but really helped to balance the visual design of the widgets and we were super grateful to have their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-the-top-read-widget&quot;&gt;Designing the Top read widget&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/wikipedia-widget/wikipedia-top-read-widget.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the top read widget&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    The Top read widget highlights which articles are popular in your language’s Wikipedia
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing what the world is reading on Wikipedia is a constant source of fascination for many readers and editors (ourselves included!). We had previously supported a Top read widget in the older iOS style and were glad to have the time to be able to update this widget and bring it to the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first considerations with this widget was how to display articles that might not have an associated image, without needing to use a placeholder image. We wanted to avoid placeholder images as they don’t include relevant, encyclopedic content and can be repetitive if reproduced multiple times in a list. This was most important for the smallest size widget which only has space to link to one article. For the small widget with an available image we went with a full bleed image with a small spark map representing the popularity of the article over the past week. This sparkline was then enlarged and used as the primary imagery for articles that did not have an associated image. The sparklines were also included in the largest widget size, where we had just enough room to fit the top four articles, their associated sparklines and their title descriptions. For the medium sized widget we wanted to ensure that we could show more articles than were available on the small widget, so we focused on presenting two articles without their sparklines vs. one article with more meta information than we could show on the small widget size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This widget was also quite easy to translate into both light and dark designs as we were able to utilize our existing color palettes, which were designed to share the green used in the sparklines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-the-widgets&quot;&gt;Building the widgets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new widgets also gave the engineering team an opportunity to experiment with new platform technologies. The widgets are implemented using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui&quot;&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/a&gt; – Apple’s new user interface toolkit that aims to help bridge the gap between design and implementation. Converting the Top read sparkline we currently use in the app to SwiftUI provided valuable practical experience. It was encouraging to see potentially complex interface elements translate elegantly to the new framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineering work began during the early betas of iOS 14. The biggest implementation challenge we faced was using the unfinished development tools. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger&quot;&gt;debugger&lt;/a&gt;, a tool used during development to examine the state of running widgets, often failed to work at all. Another challenge we encountered was balancing the expectation of always updated widget data with being considerate of the device’s battery life. This remains something we’re interested in refining – &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wikimedia/wikipedia-ios&quot;&gt;contributions are always welcome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;increased-multilingual-support&quot;&gt;Increased multilingual support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the widgets utilize each reader’s primary language as set in app settings. We would like to provide a way for multilingual readers to set a language preference on a per-widget basis, which would enable readers to keep an eye on what articles are trending on multiple Wikipedias or see what was happening on this day in history across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-dynamic-on-this-day-widget&quot;&gt;More dynamic On this day widget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The On this day widget currently updates once a day and highlights a single event each day. In the future we would like to make this widget more dynamic by featuring multiple events each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-widget-ideas&quot;&gt;Future widget ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to time constraints we were unable to build all of the widgets that we dreamed up. In the future we would love to update three of our older style widgets: Today’s featured article, In the news and Continue reading. Additionally we had some ideas around a widget that would enable you to jump straight into exploring Wikipedia with deep links into features like randomizer or reading lists. Finally, we had designed a map based widget that built off of our Places feature and would have enabled readers to quickly locate and read Wikipedia articles about landmarks near them.&lt;/p&gt;
